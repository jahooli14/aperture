  "decision": "merged",
  "reasoning": [
    "The new article introduces 'Skills,' a significant new capability for Claude agents, directly relevant to how agents execute workflows and leverage tools.",
    "Skills align with and exemplify existing 'Tool Design Philosophy' principles, particularly 'Quality Over Quantity' (by encapsulating complex workflows and institutional knowledge) and 'Targeted Operations' (by applying specific methodologies automatically).",
    "The information comes from official Anthropic sources (linked from the Reddit post), providing high evidence.",
    "The new content complements and extends the existing philosophy rather than replacing it, making MERGE the optimal mode.",
    "Integration as a concise bullet point under an existing principle (e.g., 'Quality Over Quantity') maximizes information density with minimal token growth, adhering to the 'MINIMAL' goal.",
    "The new content is 'FRONTIER-QUALITY' as it describes a new, advanced agent capability."
