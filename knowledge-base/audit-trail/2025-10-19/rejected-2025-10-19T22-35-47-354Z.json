  "reasoning": [
    "The current documentation section 'Tool Design Philosophy' focuses on principles for *designing* high-quality tools (e.g., targeted operations, high-signal output, error context) for agents, sourced from Anthropic (high authority).",
    "The new article introduces 'Agentic RAG,' which describes an agentic *workflow* or *architecture* where agents dynamically use tools, rather than principles for *designing* the tools themselves. This is a different, albeit related, scope.",
    "The new article's source (`devto-ai`, authority 0.6) does not meet the evidence threshold (0.75) required for merging new content into this high-quality, Anthropic-sourced documentation, which prioritizes frontier-quality and authoritative sources.",
    "The article contains promotional content ('Festive Diwali Offer') and external links (YouTube, GitHub) that are not suitable for direct integration into minimal, high-density documentation.",
    "Integrating this content would dilute the specific focus of the 'Tool Design Philosophy' section and introduce less authoritative information without a clear token reduction or significant value add to *this specific section*. While 'Agentic RAG' is a valuable concept, it would be better placed in a section dedicated to agent architectures or workflow patterns, if such a section existed and met higher evidence standards."
