    "The existing documentation section focuses on 'Tool Design Philosophy' (principles for *creating* tools).",
    "The new article focuses on 'Profiling Guide' (principles for *measuring performance* of tools, specifically NeMo agents).",
    "These are distinct topics. The new article does not directly enhance or update the core design philosophy principles.",
    "Integrating this content would introduce a new, advanced topic (performance profiling) that is out of scope for the current section's stated purpose.",
    "The source authority (reddit-llmdevs, 0.5) is not high enough to warrant a direct merge or replacement, especially for a foundational design philosophy section.",
    "Adding this content would increase token count without maximizing value for the 'Tool Design Philosophy' section, thus diluting its focus.",
    "This content would be valuable in a dedicated 'Performance & Observability' or 'Profiling Tools' section, but not here."
