    "The new article discusses 'Usage Limits and Performance Discussion' for Claude AI, focusing on user experiences and community reporting.",
    "The current documentation section is 'Tool Design Philosophy', outlining principles for building effective tools (e.g., targeted operations, high-signal output, error handling).",
    "These two topics are fundamentally distinct. The new article is about operational feedback for an existing AI model, not about the design principles for creating tools.",
    "Integrating this content would dilute the focus of the 'Tool Design Philosophy' section and introduce irrelevant information, decreasing information density.",
    "The new article's source (reddit-claude, authority: 0.4) is not authoritative for tool design philosophy, especially compared to the current section's Anthropic engineering source.",
    "No supersession indicators (version upgrades, official announcements, quantifiable improvements relevant to tool design) are present.",
    "The content does not offer concrete examples or implementable guidance for tool design, nor does it provide quantifiable benefits in that context."
