    "The current documentation section 'Tool Design Philosophy' is sourced from Anthropic, a highly authoritative source for this domain (implied evidence: 1.0).",
    "The new article is from 'reddit-llmdevs' (authority: 0.5), a self-promotional post about a specific open-source framework (Datapizza AI). This significantly lowers its evidence score for general design philosophy.",
    "The new content primarily describes features and benefits of a specific product (Datapizza AI) rather than general, actionable tool design philosophy principles that would directly enhance or supersede the existing content.",
    "While themes like 'debuggability' and 'less abstraction, more control' resonate with existing principles (High-Signal Output, Error Context, Quality Over Quantity), the current documentation already covers these with more direct, implementable examples and from a more authoritative source.",
    "Integrating this content would dilute the overall quality and authority of the 'Tool Design Philosophy' section and add bloat without providing new, frontier-quality, or more information-dense insights for *general tool design*.",
    "No direct supersession (version upgrade, API change, quantifiable improvement) of the existing design philosophy principles is present."
