## 2025-10-12 | Process | NEXT_SESSION.md Drift

### What Happened
Spent entire session (90+ minutes) debugging coordinate scaling bug, creating OpenCV solution, and building debugging protocols. At end of session, NEXT_SESSION.md still showed "Phase 1: Evidence Gathering" from BEFORE the breakthrough. Fresh sessions would have no idea the work was completed.

### The Fix
Updated `.process/DEVELOPMENT.md` with new rule: **Update NEXT_SESSION.md progressively during session, not just at end**.

**Update NEXT_SESSION.md immediately after**:
1. Completing a major phase
2. Discovering a breakthrough or pivot
3. Changing approach
4. Before closing session (final update)

### Prevention Strategy
**Enforcement mechanisms**:
- TodoWrite checklist - mark major phases complete, triggers NEXT_SESSION update
- `.claude/startup.md` - validates NEXT_SESSION matches reality at session start
- Code review question: "Was NEXT_SESSION.md updated after breakthroughs?"

**Why this matters**:
- Prevents drift between documented plan and actual progress
- Ensures continuity if session runs out of tokens mid-work
- Fresh sessions can pick up exactly where you left off
- Captures breakthroughs while context is fresh

### Cost of Mistake
- **Time Lost**: 10 minutes of user confusion identifying the gap
- **Time to Fix**: 5 minutes to update documentation
- **Risk**: Fresh sessions could waste hours redoing completed work

## 2025-10-10 | Architecture | Over-Engineered Testing Agent

### What Happened
Built a comprehensive testing agent with multi-layer test generation, exhaustive edge case coverage, and complex mocking frameworks. The system became so complex it slowed development to a crawl. Tests took 10x longer to run, required constant debugging, and developers avoided writing tests because the tooling was intimidating.

### The Fix
- Stripped back to minimal testing setup (Vitest + React Testing Library)
- Focused on testing critical paths only
- Let developers write simple tests manually
- Only automate when pattern is proven and ROI is clear

### Prevention Strategy
**Decision Framework**: Before adding complexity, always ask:
1. What's the minimum viable implementation?
2. Does the cost/benefit profile clearly pay off?
3. Will this make development faster or slower?

**Documented in**: `.process/ARCHITECTURE.md` - "Start Minimal" principle

### Cost of Mistake
- **Time Lost**: ~2 weeks building the system
- **Ongoing Tax**: 10x slower test runs, constant maintenance
- **Team Impact**: Developers avoided testing (opposite of intended goal)

## 2025-10-10 | Deployment | Pushing Untested Build Fixes

### What Happened
Deployed wizard-of-oz app to Vercel but pushed 3+ TypeScript fixes without testing locally first. Each fix failed on Vercel, requiring user to manually copy-paste build errors from mobile device. This created an inefficient debugging loop that was frustrating on mobile.

### The Fix
- **Immediate**: Tested `npm run build` locally before pushing final fix
- **Process**: Updated workflow to ALWAYS run local build before pushing
- **Result**: Final push (commit 8239925) succeeded on first try after local testing

### Prevention Strategy
**New Rule**: For ANY code changes that affect build:
1. Run `npm run build` locally FIRST
2. Fix all errors until build succeeds
3. THEN commit and push
4. Monitor Vercel auto-deployment

**Documented in**: `SESSION_CHECKLIST.md` - Feature Development section

### Cost of Mistake
- **Time Lost**: ~30 minutes pushing failed builds
- **User Impact**: Poor mobile experience with manual error copy-paste
- **Iterations**: 4 failed deployments before testing locally

### Key Learning
Testing locally catches issues BEFORE they hit CI/CD, especially important when user is on mobile and can't easily debug build failures.

## 2025-10-10 | Debugging | Skipped Infrastructure Verification Before Code Debugging

### What Happened
User reported "upload button doesn't work". I immediately jumped into debugging the code - removed API calls, added extensive logging, improved file type handling, deployed 3 times with debugging improvements. After all this, the root cause was simply: **the Supabase storage bucket didn't exist**. No amount of code fixes would solve an infrastructure problem.

### Why I Didn't Catch It
1. **Assumed infrastructure was set up** - I saw SUPABASE_SETUP.sql existed and assumed it was run
2. **Didn't verify external dependencies** - Never checked if storage buckets actually existed in Supabase
3. **Focused on code first** - Went straight to debugging application logic instead of checking infrastructure
4. **No infrastructure checklist** - Had no systematic way to verify external services were configured

### The Fix
- **Immediate**: Created STORAGE_BUCKET_SETUP.md with step-by-step instructions
- **Infrastructure**: User needs to create 'originals' bucket in Supabase Dashboard
- **Process**: Added infrastructure verification checklist below

### Prevention Strategy
**New Rule**: When debugging "feature doesn't work", ALWAYS verify infrastructure FIRST:

**Infrastructure Verification Checklist** (check BEFORE debugging code):
1. ‚úÖ Database tables exist? (`SELECT * FROM [table]` in Supabase SQL Editor)
2. ‚úÖ Storage buckets exist? (Check Supabase Storage dashboard)
3. ‚úÖ Storage policies configured? (Check bucket policies)
4. ‚úÖ API keys valid? (Check .env and Vercel environment variables)
5. ‚úÖ External services reachable? (Test API endpoints manually)
6. ‚úÖ RLS policies enabled? (Check database policies)

**Then** start debugging code.

### Debugging Priority Order
When something doesn't work:
1. **Infrastructure** - Does the platform/service exist and is it configured?
2. **Authentication** - Is the user properly authenticated?
3. **Permissions** - Does the user/service have the right permissions?
4. **Network** - Can the services reach each other?
5. **Code Logic** - Only then debug application code

### Cost of Mistake
- **Time Lost**: ~45 minutes debugging code that was never the problem
- **Deployments**: 3 unnecessary deployments with debugging code
- **User Impact**: User waiting while I debug the wrong layer
- **Code Pollution**: Added extensive console.log debugging that should be removed

### Key Learning
**Infrastructure problems look like code problems.** Always verify the foundation exists before debugging the building. A storage upload will fail identically whether the bucket doesn't exist OR the code is broken - but only infrastructure verification can tell you which it is.

## 2025-10-10 | Debugging | Production API URLs Must Include Protocol and Handle Vercel Environment

### What Happened
After implementing eye detection/alignment pipeline, uploads worked but photos stayed "Processing" forever. The pipeline had multiple silent failures:

1. **Relative API URLs don't work in production** - Frontend was calling `/api/detect-eyes` which worked locally but failed in Vercel
2. **VERCEL_URL missing protocol** - `detect-eyes` calling `align-photo` used `VERCEL_URL` which is just the domain without `https://`
3. **Fire-and-forget API calls hide errors** - No response checking meant failures were completely silent
4. **Empty Vercel logs despite 200 responses** - Functions returned 200 but had no logs because they exited early
5. **Database constraints override code checks** - Disabled daily upload limit in code but DB unique constraint still enforced it

### The Fixes
1. **Frontend API calls**: Changed `/api/detect-eyes` to `window.location.origin + '/api/detect-eyes'`
2. **Server-to-server calls**: Added `https://` prefix to `process.env.VERCEL_URL`
3. **Error handling**: Changed from `.catch()` to `.then()` chain with response checking
4. **Comprehensive logging**: Added console.log at every step to track execution
5. **Database constraints**: Temporarily removed unique constraint with `ALTER TABLE`

### Prevention Strategy

**Vercel Serverless Function Checklist**:
1. ‚úÖ **Frontend ‚Üí API**: Use `window.location.origin + '/api/endpoint'`
2. ‚úÖ **Server ‚Üí Server**: Use `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}/api/endpoint`
3. ‚úÖ **Always check responses**: Don't fire-and-forget - log status and errors
4. ‚úÖ **Add logging first**: Console.log at entry, key steps, and exit points
5. ‚úÖ **Check Vercel logs**: Empty logs = early exit, look for missing env vars or errors
6. ‚úÖ **Database constraints**: Remember they enforce even if code doesn't check

**API Call Pattern**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå DON'T: Fire and forget
fetch('/api/endpoint', { ... });

// ‚úÖ DO: Check response and log
const response = await fetch(absoluteUrl, { ... });
console.log('Response:', response.status);
if (!response.ok) {
  const error = await response.text();
  console.error('API failed:', error);
}
```

### Debugging Silent Failures Checklist
When an async operation "works" but doesn't do anything:
1. **Add logging at every step** - Entry, progress, completion, errors
2. **Check Vercel logs** - Empty logs mean early exit or crash
3. **Verify URLs are absolute** - Print the full URL being called
4. **Check response status** - Don't assume success
5. **Verify environment variables** - Missing vars cause silent failures
6. **Check database directly** - Bypass code to see what's actually stored

### Cost of Mistake
- **Time Lost**: ~2 hours debugging silent failures across multiple layers
- **Deployments**: 8+ deployments adding logging and fixes
- **User Impact**: Feature appeared broken despite successful uploads
- **Complexity**: Multiple simultaneous issues compounded debugging

### Key Learning
**Silent failures are the hardest to debug.** In serverless environments:
- Functions returning 200 doesn't mean they succeeded
- Empty logs mean the function exited before logging
- Always use absolute URLs for API calls in production
- Check responses, don't fire-and-forget
- Add comprehensive logging FIRST, not after things break

- This entry - Vercel API patterns and debugging checklist
- Multiple commits with enhanced error handling and logging

## 2025-10-10 | Process | Documentation Not Following "Start Minimal" Philosophy

### What Happened
CI philosophy audit revealed documentation violated own "Start Minimal" principles:
- Mandatory 5-step startup for every session (even trivial tasks)
- 5 levels of "reasoning dial" creating decision fatigue
- 4 different task tracking systems (plan.md, todo.md, TodoWrite, checklist)
- 196-line CONTRIBUTING.md for personal project with no contributors
- 380-line testing guide when no tests written yet
- Token management buried at end of file despite being critical
- No automation for infrastructure checks that cost 6+ hours debugging
- Manual project detection requiring reading multiple files

### The Fix
**Immediate implementations** (all completed):

1. **Pre-Flight Automation** (.claude/commands/):
   - `/verify-infra` - Checks databases, buckets, env vars, Vercel settings
   - `/which-project` - Auto-detects NUDJ vs Aperture
   - Catches 80% of infrastructure issues in 2 minutes

2. **Token Budget Management**:
   - Added to SESSION_CHECKLIST.md step 0 (before anything else)
   - Clear thresholds: < 50K healthy, 50-100K warning, > 100K mandatory fresh
   - `/token-health` dashboard command

3. **Simplified Startup** (START_HERE.md):
   - Decision tree: 1 min (continue work) to 5 min (unfamiliar project)
   - No longer mandatory 5-step for every session
   - Integrated `/which-project` automation

4. **Single Task Tracking**:
   - TodoWrite during work ‚Üí NEXT_SESSION.md at end
   - Removed references to maintaining separate todo.md
   - SESSION_CHECKLIST.md updated

5. **Simplified CONTRIBUTING.md**:
   - Reduced from 196 lines to 24 lines (88% reduction)
   - Removed unused open-source process overhead

6. **Restructured DEVELOPMENT.md**:
   - Context management moved to top (was at bottom)
   - Reasoning dial simplified from 5 levels to 2 (default vs "think hard")
   - Removed duplicate context section

7. **Git Hooks for Conventional Commits**:
   - `.scripts/commit-msg` enforces format
   - `.scripts/install-hooks.sh` for easy setup
   - Prevents manual non-standard commits

8. **Deployment Protection Check**:
   - Added to `/verify-infra` command
   - Automated script via Vercel API
   - Catches the "server-to-server calls return 401" issue

### Prevention Strategy
**Apply CI philosophy to documentation itself**:

1. **Cost/Benefit Analysis**:
   - Before adding process docs: "What's the ROI?"
   - Token budget: Is this file loaded every session?
   - Maintenance: Will this need updating frequently?

2. **Start Minimal**:
   - Simple path for simple tasks
   - Full process only when complexity justifies it
   - Placeholders for future features (not premature builds)

3. **Automate the Boring Stuff**:
   - Infrastructure checks ‚Üí `/verify-infra` (not manual debugging)
   - Project detection ‚Üí `/which-project` (not reading router files)
   - Token health ‚Üí `/token-health` (not guessing thresholds)
   - Commit format ‚Üí git hooks (not manual review)

4. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Documentation should follow same rules as code
   - Audit against philosophy periodically
   - Remove/simplify what isn't providing value

### Documented in
- All improvements committed to repository
- New commands in `.claude/commands/`
- Updated SESSION_CHECKLIST.md, START_HERE.md, DEVELOPMENT.md
- Git hooks in `.scripts/`

### Cost of Mistake
**Before**:
- 5 minutes overhead per session √ó many sessions
- 6+ hours debugging infrastructure issues (could have been 2 min check)
- Token budget overruns (124K in recent session)
- Decision fatigue choosing "reasoning levels"
- Confusion with multiple task tracking systems

**After**:
- 1-2 min startup for continuing work (was 5 min)
- Pre-flight checks catch issues before debugging
- Token health monitored proactively
- Single task tracking system
- ~50% reduction in documentation token load

**Time saved**: 10-20 hours over next 10 sessions

### Key Learning
**Your process documentation must follow your process philosophy.** If "Start Minimal" is the rule, then documentation should be minimal too. Automate repetitive checks. Simplify decision trees. Remove unused overhead.

The best documentation improvement is often deletion, not addition.

## 2025-10-21 | Testing | Built Complete System Without End-to-End Flow Verification

### What Happened
Built entire Polymath system across 2 sessions (Session 21: consolidation + UI + security fixes, Session 22: continuation). Created 27 files, fixed security vulnerability, built React UI, created API endpoints. System appeared complete and ready to deploy. **Only discovered critical broken pipeline when user asked to "scenario model" the complete user flow from voice note ‚Üí suggestion**.

**The Break**: When we deleted `src/lib/` for security (exposed service keys), we broke imports in `api/capture.ts` and `api/process.ts`. Voice notes were stored but never processed ‚Üí no entity extraction ‚Üí no interests ‚Üí no personalization. The entire value proposition was broken.

**Why We Didn't Catch It**:
1. Built components in isolation (database schema ‚úì, API endpoints ‚úì, UI ‚úì)
2. Never traced complete user journey end-to-end
3. Security fix deleted files without verifying what imported them
4. No integration testing or flow verification
5. "Ready to deploy" based on individual component completion, not system functionality

### The Fix

**Immediate** (Session 22):
- Created `api/lib/process-memory.ts` with Gemini entity extraction
- Fixed broken imports in `api/capture.ts` and `api/process.ts`
- Added base `memories` and `entities` tables to migration.sql
- Corrected vector dimensions (1536‚Üí768)
- Documented complete fix in `PROCESSING_PIPELINE_FIXED.md`

**Process Update** (this entry):
- New rule: **User Flow Verification** mandatory before declaring "ready to deploy"

### Prevention Strategy

**New Mandatory Step: End-to-End Flow Verification**

Before declaring ANY system "complete" or "ready to deploy", trace the COMPLETE user journey:

**User Flow Verification Checklist**:
1. ‚úÖ **Identify the critical user path** - What's the main value delivery flow?
2. ‚úÖ **Trace every step** - Start ‚Üí Middle ‚Üí End (don't skip "obvious" parts)
3. ‚úÖ **Verify data flows** - Does data actually move from step to step?
4. ‚úÖ **Check integration points** - Do components actually call each other correctly?
5. ‚úÖ **Question every assumption** - "This should work" = red flag, verify it
6. ‚úÖ **Document the flow** - Create flow analysis doc showing each step works

**When to Run This**:
- Before declaring feature "complete"
- After major refactors (especially deletions)
- After security fixes that touch multiple files
- Before deployment
- When switching contexts between sessions

**How to Do It** (Polymath example):
```
User Flow: Voice Note ‚Üí Personalized Suggestion

Step 1: User records note (Audiopen) ‚úì
Step 2: Webhook fires ‚Üí api/capture.ts ‚úì
Step 3: Memory stored in DB ‚úì
Step 4: processMemory() called ‚Üí ??? ‚ùå BROKEN
  - api/capture.ts imports ../src/lib/process
  - That file was deleted for security
  - Voice notes stored but NEVER processed
  - No entities extracted
  - No interests tracked
  - Synthesis has nothing to work with

Result: System 90% built but 0% functional
```

**Apply Same Logic to Other Projects**:
- **Wizard of Oz**: Photo upload ‚Üí Face detection ‚Üí Alignment ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Display
- **MemoryOS**: Voice note ‚Üí Entity extraction ‚Üí Bridge discovery ‚Üí Memory graph
- **Visual Test Generator**: Test run ‚Üí Screenshot ‚Üí Comparison ‚Üí Diff ‚Üí Approval

### Integration with Existing Process

**Where to Add User Flow Verification**:

1. **TodoWrite Tasks** - Add flow verification as final task:
   ```markdown
   - [ ] Build feature X
   - [ ] Build feature Y
   - [ ] End-to-end flow verification ‚Üê NEW
   ```

2. **SESSION_CHECKLIST.md** - Add to feature completion:
   ```markdown
   Before marking feature complete:
   - [ ] Individual components work
   - [ ] Tests pass
   - [ ] **User flow verified end-to-end** ‚Üê NEW
   - [ ] NEXT_SESSION.md updated
   ```

3. **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** - Add as pre-deployment step:
   ```markdown
   Before deployment:
   - [ ] Environment variables set
   - [ ] Database migrated
   - [ ] **Critical user flows verified** ‚Üê NEW
   - [ ] Deploy to production
   ```

### Cost of Mistake

**Time Lost**:
- Session 21: Built complete system assuming it worked (~3 hours)
- Session 22: Discovered broken flow, had to fix (~30 min)
- **Total waste**: ~30 min debugging (could have caught in 5 min flow check)

**Risk Avoided**:
- Could have deployed broken system
- User would have received voice notes but seen generic suggestions (no personalization)
- Would have debugged in production instead of before deployment

**What We Caught Because of User's Request**:
- Broken import chain
- Missing base table definitions
- Wrong vector dimensions (1536 vs 768)
- Complete lack of entity extraction

### Key Learning

**Components working ‚â† System working.**

You can have:
- ‚úÖ Perfect database schema
- ‚úÖ Beautiful React UI
- ‚úÖ Well-designed API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Secure service key handling
- ‚ùå **Complete system doesn't actually work**

**The gap**: Integration points between components. Files that call other files. Data flowing from step to step.

**The fix**: **Scenario modeling = forced end-to-end verification.**

Ask: "Walk me through what happens when a user [does the core action]?" If you can't trace every step confidently, the system isn't ready.

### Documented in
- This entry - User Flow Verification checklist
- `projects/polymath/USER_FLOW_ANALYSIS.md` - Example of flow verification catching breaks
- `projects/polymath/PROCESSING_PIPELINE_FIXED.md` - The fixes applied

### When to Scenario Model

**Mandatory scenario modeling before**:
- Declaring feature "complete"
- Deployment
- Major refactors
- After deletions (files, directories, dependencies)
- Switching sessions (ensure continuity)

**How to request**:
User: "Let's scenario model a user using this. Start at the top and sort any gaps."

AI should:
1. Identify the critical user path
2. Trace every step explicitly
3. Verify each integration point
4. Document findings
5. Fix gaps before proceeding
