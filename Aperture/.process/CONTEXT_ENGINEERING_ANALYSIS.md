## Proposed Best Practices Summary

### Key Principles from Research

1. **Contextual Grounding (Mandatory)**
   - Response MUST be grounded exclusively in provided XML documentation
   - Quote relevant sections with line numbers before generating code
   - Cite sources for all decisions

2. **Retrieval Verification**
   - If context insufficient, use MCP tools to query external docs
   - Must state query parameters explicitly
   - Reference architecture and file paths from CLAUDE.md

3. **Action State Management**
   - Create/update task checklist in CLAUDE.md for multi-step tasks
   - Detail required steps, file modifications, verification commands
   - Check off items only after successful execution and verification
   - Document step-by-step process

4. **Output Format**
   - Provide full revised code files for modified files only
   - Maintain brevity and authority in explanations

## Current Aperture Process

### ‚úÖ What We Already Do Well

#### 1. **Contextual Grounding**
- ‚úÖ `START_HERE.md` - mandatory entry point
- ‚úÖ `NEXT_SESSION.md` - current state documentation
- ‚úÖ `CLAUDE-APERTURE.md` - project patterns and conventions
- ‚úÖ `.claude/startup.md` - automatic context loading
- ‚úÖ Project-specific READMEs and plan.md files

**Strength**: We have strong foundational documentation that grounds every session.

#### 2. **Retrieval Verification**
- ‚úÖ File reading tools (Read, Glob, Grep)
- ‚úÖ Slash commands for infrastructure checks (`/verify-infra`, `/vercel-logs`)
- ‚úÖ Explicit "if unclear, ask" guidance in startup docs

**Strength**: We have tools and explicit permission to query when context is insufficient.

#### 3. **Action State Management**
- ‚úÖ `TodoWrite` tool for tracking tasks
- ‚úÖ Multi-step task breakdowns in NEXT_SESSION.md
- ‚úÖ Session Checklist for workflow
- ‚úÖ RECENTLY ADDED: Progressive NEXT_SESSION.md updates during session

**Strength**: We track progress and state throughout sessions.

#### 4. **Output Format**
- ‚úÖ Concise, direct communication style (documented in CLAUDE.md)
- ‚úÖ Code-focused outputs with minimal preamble
- ‚úÖ "Do what's asked, nothing more" principle

**Strength**: We avoid verbose explanations and focus on action.

## üîç Gaps Identified

### Gap 1: **Source Citation & Line Number References**

**Proposed Practice**:
> "Before generating any code, you must quote the relevant sections (including line numbers from `<source>` tag) from `<document_content>` elements"

**Current Practice**:
- We reference files by name but don't consistently cite line numbers
- We don't quote relevant sections before making decisions
- No explicit "grounding statement" before code generation

**Example of Gap**:
```
‚ùå Current: "I'll update the alignment function"
‚úÖ Proposed: "Based on NEXT_SESSION.md:75-90 which states 'Implement coordinate
scaling', I'll update the alignment function in align-photo-v4.ts"
```

**Impact**: Medium
- Makes reasoning traceable
- Helps user verify decisions
- Creates audit trail

**Recommendation**: üü° IMPLEMENT PARTIALLY
- Add for major decisions only (not every line)
- Format: `file_path:line_number` (we already use this pattern!)
- Example: "Per META_DEBUGGING_PROTOCOL.md:88-92, verifying inputs first"

---

### Gap 2: **Explicit MCP Query Documentation**

**Proposed Practice**:
> "You must clearly state the parameters of the query you execute"

**Current Practice**:
- We use tools (Glob, Grep, Read) but don't explicitly state query parameters beforehand
- Tool usage is reactive, not declarative

**Example of Gap**:
```
‚ùå Current: [Uses Grep tool silently]
‚úÖ Proposed: "Querying codebase for 'align-photo' pattern in *.ts files to
locate implementation. Query params: pattern='align-photo', glob='**/*.ts'"
```

**Impact**: Low
- Adds verbosity without much value
- User can see tool calls in UI already

**Recommendation**: ‚ùå DON'T IMPLEMENT
- Current approach is sufficient
- Tool results are visible to user
- Adding explicit query documentation is redundant noise

---

### Gap 3: **Dedicated Task Checklist in CLAUDE.md**

**Proposed Practice**:
> "Create or update a dedicated task checklist within the CLAUDE.md file"

**Current Practice**:
- We use `TodoWrite` tool (ephemeral, session-scoped)
- Task lists in NEXT_SESSION.md (persistent but separate file)
- No centralized task tracking IN CLAUDE.md itself

**Example of Gap**:
```
‚ùå Current: Tasks in NEXT_SESSION.md + TodoWrite tool
‚úÖ Proposed: Section in CLAUDE-APERTURE.md:
   ## Current Tasks
   - [x] Fix coordinate scaling
   - [ ] Deploy to production
   - [ ] Clean up test files
```

**Impact**: High
- Creates single source of truth for project state
- Persistent across sessions without separate file
- CLAUDE.md is already the entry point

**Recommendation**: üü¢ IMPLEMENT
- Add "## Current Tasks" section to CLAUDE-APERTURE.md
- Update during session (not just TodoWrite)
- Format: `- [ ] Task` / `- [x] Task` for markdown compatibility
- Link to NEXT_SESSION.md for detailed context

---

### Gap 4: **Verification Command Documentation**

**Proposed Practice**:
> "Detail required steps, file modifications, and verification commands"

**Current Practice**:
- We document what to do but not always HOW to verify
- Verification is implicit ("check logs") not explicit commands

**Example of Gap**:
```
‚ùå Current: "Deploy and verify it works"
‚úÖ Proposed:
   - [ ] Deploy to Vercel
   - [ ] Verify: `curl https://api.vercel.com/.../deployments`
   - [ ] Verify: `/vercel-logs align-photo 10`
   - [ ] Verify: Check for errors in output
```

**Impact**: Medium
- Makes tasks more actionable
- Ensures nothing is missed
- Creates repeatable process

**Recommendation**: üü¢ IMPLEMENT
- Add explicit verification commands to task lists
- Format: `Verify: <command or check>`
- Include in NEXT_SESSION.md task breakdowns

---

### Gap 5: **Full File Output Policy**

**Proposed Practice**:
> "Provide the full, revised code files only for the specific files modified"

**Current Practice**:
- We often use `Edit` tool (partial updates)
- Sometimes show full files, sometimes just snippets
- No consistent policy

**Example of Gap**:
```
‚ùå Current: Edit tool changes one function
‚úÖ Proposed: Show entire file after modification for context
```

**Impact**: Low (for our use case)
- Full files add token usage for large files
- Edit tool is more precise
- Depends on file size

**Recommendation**: üü° CONDITIONAL
- Small files (< 200 lines): Show full file after Edit
- Large files: Use Edit tool, show context around change
- Add policy to DEVELOPMENT.md

---

## üéØ Recommended Changes

### Priority 1: HIGH IMPACT üü¢

#### 1. Add "Current Tasks" Section to CLAUDE-APERTURE.md

**Location**: After "Quick Start" section

**Format**:
```markdown
## üéØ Current Tasks & Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-12

### Active Work
- [x] Fix coordinate scaling bug in alignment
- [x] Implement Python OpenCV solution
- [x] Create debugging protocols
- [ ] Create production Node.js wrapper for OpenCV
  - Verify: `npm run build` succeeds
  - Verify: `/vercel-logs align-photo 10` shows no errors
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
  - Verify: `curl https://wizard-of-oz.vercel.app/api/align-photo`
- [ ] Clean up test scripts

**See NEXT_SESSION.md for detailed context and implementation notes.**
```

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth in main documentation
- Quick status check without reading full NEXT_SESSION.md
- Persistent across sessions
- Includes verification commands

**Update Frequency**:
- After completing major tasks
- After breakthroughs or pivots
- Before closing session

---

#### 2. Add Verification Commands to Task Lists

**Update**: `.process/DEVELOPMENT.md` and NEXT_SESSION.md templates

**New Rule**:
Every task in a checklist must include verification step if applicable.

**Format**:
```markdown
- [ ] Deploy new alignment function
  - Verify: `git push && vercel --prod`
  - Verify: Check deployment logs for errors
  - Verify: Upload test photo and check alignment
```

**Template**:
```markdown
## Task Template

**Do**:
- [ ] <Action to take>

**Verify**:
- Command: `<command to run>`
- Expected: <what you should see>
- If fail: <troubleshooting step>
```

---

### Priority 2: MEDIUM IMPACT üü°

#### 3. Add Source Citation Pattern

**Update**: `.process/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Add section on "Decision Documentation"

**New Rule**:
For major decisions (not every edit), cite source documentation.

**Format**:
```
Based on <file_path:line_number>, which states "<quote>", I will <action>.
```

**When Required**:
- Architectural decisions
- Choosing between approaches
- Following documented patterns
- Debugging protocol steps

**Example**:
```
Based on META_DEBUGGING_PROTOCOL.md:88-92, which states "verify inputs before
debugging algorithm", I'm checking coordinate dimensions before debugging the
alignment logic.
```

**Benefits**:
- Makes reasoning traceable
- User can verify decisions
- We already use `file:line` pattern for code references
- Extends to documentation references

---

#### 4. File Output Policy

**Update**: `.process/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Add "Code Output Standards"

**New Rule**:
```markdown
## Code Output Standards

**When to show full files**:
- File < 200 lines after modification
- New files being created
- Major refactoring (> 30% of file changed)

**When to use Edit tool**:
- File > 200 lines and < 30% changed
- Precise single-function updates
- Small bug fixes

**Always include**:
- File path with line numbers for references
- Context: What changed and why
- Verification step if applicable
```

---

### Priority 3: LOW IMPACT / DON'T IMPLEMENT ‚ùå

#### 5. Explicit MCP Query Documentation

**Decision**: Don't implement

**Reason**:
- Tool results are visible in UI
- Adds verbosity without value
- Current approach is sufficient
