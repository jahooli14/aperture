# Development Workflow

> **Version**: 2.0 - Optimized for CI philosophy (Start Minimal, Cost/Benefit)

## üö® CRITICAL: Context Window Management

**Most important rule**: AI performance degrades as context grows. Fresh context > struggling with degraded performance.

### When to Start a New Session

**Mandatory fresh start when**:
- ‚úÖ Context window > 100K tokens used
- ‚úÖ Starting completely new feature or project
- ‚úÖ Switching to different part of codebase
- ‚úÖ Noticing degraded response quality (slow, confused, errors)
- ‚úÖ Planning major architectural changes

**Optional fresh start when**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Current task completed (natural break point)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Stuck on problem (fresh perspective helps)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple tangential discussions (context pollution)

**Continue current session when**:
- ‚ùå In middle of implementing a plan
- ‚ùå Debugging with accumulated context
- ‚ùå Making small related changes
- ‚ùå Context < 50K tokens and performance good

### Token Budget Health Check

| Token Usage | Status | Action |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| < 50K | ‚úÖ Healthy | Continue normally |
| 50-100K | ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning | Can I finish current task in < 50K more? If no ‚Üí fresh session |
| > 100K | üõë Critical | MANDATORY fresh session |

**Check token usage at**:
- Start of session (in SESSION_CHECKLIST.md)
- Before starting new work
- When noticing degraded quality

### Session Handoff Protocol

**Before closing a session**:
1. Update `NEXT_SESSION.md` (current state, next steps, blockers)
2. Update project `plan.md` (check off completed items)
3. Commit all changes (clean state for next session)

**Starting a new session** (< 5 minutes):
1. Read `NEXT_SESSION.md` (always start here)
2. Read relevant `plan.md` (project-specific state)
3. Quick git check: `git log --oneline -10`

**DON'T**: Try to re-read entire conversation or reload full context.

## Core Principle: Plan First, Execute Second

Never go straight from idea to code for non-trivial tasks. **Separate thinking from doing**.

---

## Plan Mode Discipline

### When to Use Plan Mode (Mandatory)
- ‚úÖ Starting any new feature
- ‚úÖ Complex refactoring across multiple files
- ‚úÖ Debugging issues where root cause is unclear
- ‚úÖ Architectural decisions with broad impact

### When to Skip Plan Mode
- ‚ùå Simple bug fixes (< 5 lines changed)
- ‚ùå Boilerplate generation
- ‚ùå Minor styling tweaks
- ‚ùå Updating documentation only

### The Plan Mode Workflow

1. **Enter Plan Mode**: Press `Shift+Tab` twice in Claude Code
2. **Describe Goal**: High-level objective (not implementation details)
3. **Receive Plan**: Claude researches codebase and generates step-by-step plan
4. **Review & Refine**: üö® **NEVER accept first version**
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Challenge assumptions
   - Request modifications
   - Iterate until plan is robust
5. **Execute**: Exit Plan Mode and implement the agreed plan

### Plan Mode Example

**‚ùå Bad (No Planning)**:
```
User: "Add authentication to the app"
Claude: [starts generating auth code immediately]
```

**‚úÖ Good (Plan First)**:
```
User: [Shift+Tab twice]
User: "Add authentication to the app"
Claude: [generates plan]
User: "What about password reset flow? And social login?"
Claude: [refines plan]
User: "Perfect, let's execute"
Claude: [implements refined plan]
```

---

## Reasoning Modes (Simplified)

**Two modes - don't overthink it**:

| Mode | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Default** | 90% of work - routine tasks, features, bugs | "Add pagination to user list" |
| **think hard** | 10% of work - critical architecture, security, "impossible" bugs | "think hard about authentication system architecture" |

**Rule**: If unsure, use default. Claude adjusts reasoning automatically. Don't waste time deciding which thinking level to use.

**Red Flag**: If you're using `think hard` frequently, you may have an architecture problem - simplify the system.

---

## Socratic Questioning: Make Claude Ask Questions

The most common AI failure mode: **proceeding on flawed assumptions**.

### The Fix: Invert the Interaction

**Before Claude starts planning or coding**, make it ask questions:

```
"Before you start implementing user authentication,
ask me clarifying questions about the requirements."
```

### What Claude Should Ask
- Edge cases: "What happens if the user's email already exists?"
- Design decisions: "Do you want social login or just email/password?"
- Security: "What's the password strength policy?"
- Integration: "Should this integrate with the existing user management system?"

### When to Use
- ‚úÖ Starting any new feature
- ‚úÖ Implementing based on vague requirements
- ‚úÖ Working in unfamiliar parts of the codebase
- ‚úÖ Security or performance-critical code

---

## Memory Externalization: Write Plans to Disk

**Problem**: Chat history is ephemeral and limited by token count.

**Solution**: Persist critical artifacts to version-controlled markdown files.

### Essential Artifacts

| File | Purpose | When to Create |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **plan.md** | Step-by-step implementation plan with checkboxes | Start of feature work |
| **architecture.md** | System design, schemas, API contracts | Project setup or major refactor |
| **decisions.md** | Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) | Whenever making a significant choice |
| **todo.md** | Dynamic task checklist | Ongoing during development |

### Example Workflow

```
User: "Create a plan for the authentication system and save it to plan.md"
Claude: [generates detailed plan and writes to plan.md]

[Later, in a new session]
User: "Read plan.md and continue implementation from where we left off"
Claude: [picks up seamlessly from saved state]
```

### Why This Matters
- **Persistence**: Survives beyond single chat session
- **Shareability**: Other developers (or AI agents) can read it
- **Version Control**: Track evolution of plans and decisions
- **Foundation for Multi-Agent Work**: Shared state for parallel development

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) with AI

TDD is ideal for AI-augmented development. The tight feedback loop constrains the AI and ensures correctness.

### The AI-TDD Workflow

1. **Generate Tests First**
   ```
   "You are now in Test-Driven Development mode.
   Write comprehensive unit tests for the UserProfile component.
   The tests should fail initially."
   ```

2. **Confirm Failure**: Run tests, verify they fail as expected

3. **Implement to Pass**
   ```
   "Write the minimum code to make these tests pass.
   Do NOT modify the test files."
   ```

4. **Iterate**: Claude runs tests, adjusts code until green

5. **Refactor**: Once passing, improve code clarity

### Critical Constraint
**Always include**: "Do NOT modify the test files."

This prevents the AI from "cheating" by changing tests to fit a flawed implementation.

### Testing Constitution
Create `knowledge-base/testing/` directory with:
- `testing-core.md`: Universal rules (framework, mocking, naming)
- `testing-components.md`: React component patterns
- `testing-api.md`: API endpoint patterns

These files provide Claude with context for generating idiomatic tests.

---

## Git Workflow

### Commit Messages (Automated)
Use the `/commit` slash command to generate Conventional Commits:

```bash
git add .
# In Claude: /commit
# Result: "feat(auth): add email magic link authentication"
```

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `feature/[name]`: New features
- `fix/[name]`: Bug fixes
- `refactor/[name]`: Code improvements without behavior change

### PR Reviews (Automated)
Install the Claude Code GitHub App for automatic PR reviews. Configure in `claude-code-review.yml`:
```yaml
focus:
  - logic errors
  - security vulnerabilities
  - performance issues
ignore:
  - style nitpicks
  - minor formatting
```

---

## Development Commands

### Slash Commands
Store in `.claude/commands/` (see `.process/SLASH_COMMANDS.md` for full list)

Essential commands:
- `/commit`: Generate conventional commit message
- `/test`: Generate unit tests for a file
- `/qa`: Code quality review
- `/refactor`: Apply clean code principles

### Creating New Commands
When you write a complex prompt more than twice, convert it to a command:

```markdown
<!-- .claude/commands/api-endpoint.md -->
Generate a new API endpoint with the following:
1. TypeScript types for request/response
2. Input validation with Zod
3. Error handling
4. Unit tests

Endpoint: $ARGUMENTS
```

Usage: `/api-endpoint POST /api/users`

---

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- **Node.js**: >= 18
- **Package Manager**: npm (or pnpm for monorepos)
- **IDE**: VS Code (with Claude Code extension) or JetBrains
- **Git**: Version control
- **Claude Code CLI**: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

### Optional (for Flow State)
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Use when**:
- ‚úÖ Inner-loop development with active supervision
- ‚úÖ Trusted, routine tasks
- ‚úÖ Local environment with version control

**Avoid when**:
- ‚ùå Wide-ranging refactors
- ‚ùå Unfamiliar codebase areas
- ‚ùå Automated CI/CD
- ‚ùå Production operations

---

## Observability Requirements: Self-Sufficient Debugging

**Core Principle**: Claude must NEVER ask users to check external logs. All debugging information must be accessible programmatically or through comprehensive in-code logging.

### The Problem

When Claude asks "Can you check the Vercel logs?", it creates friction:
- User must context-switch to Vercel dashboard
- User must manually copy/paste logs back
- Slows down debugging cycle
- User becomes a bottleneck in the development loop

### The Solution: Two-Path Strategy

#### Path A: Programmatic Log Access (Preferred)
- Use Vercel API to fetch logs directly via scripts/commands
- Create `/vercel-logs [function]` slash command
- Claude can debug autonomously without user involvement
- **Setup**: Requires Vercel API token (one-time setup)

#### Path B: Comprehensive In-Code Logging (Fallback)
- All new features include extensive console logging by default
- Logging remains until feature passes User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- After UAT approval, clean up logging as final step
- **Use when**: Vercel API not configured or for quick iterations

### Logging Requirements for New Features

**Every new feature MUST include**:

1. **Entry Point Logging**
   ```typescript
   console.log('=== FEATURE_NAME START ===');
   console.log('Input:', { param1, param2 });
   ```

2. **Decision Point Logging**
   ```typescript
   console.log('Condition check:', { condition: value, result: true/false });
   if (condition) {
     console.log('Taking path A because:', reason);
   }
   ```

3. **External Call Logging**
   ```typescript
   console.log('Calling external API:', { url, method, payload });
   const response = await fetch(...);
   console.log('External API response:', {
     status: response.status,
     ok: response.ok,
     bodyPreview: body.substring(0, 200)
   });
   ```

4. **Error Logging**
   ```typescript
   catch (error) {
     console.error('‚ùå Feature failed at step X:', error);
     console.error('Context:', { relevantState, relevantData });
     throw error; // Re-throw to maintain error propagation
   }
   ```

5. **Success Logging**
   ```typescript
   console.log('‚úÖ FEATURE_NAME COMPLETE');
   console.log('Result:', { outputSummary });
   ```

### Logging Lifecycle

```
Development ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Monitor ‚Üí UAT ‚Üí Clean Up Logs ‚Üí Done
                ‚Üë                      ‚Üì
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Bug Found ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
                      (keep logs)
```

**Stages**:
1. **Development**: Add comprehensive logging to new feature
2. **Deploy**: Push with logs intact
3. **Monitor**: Claude checks logs to verify functionality
4. **UAT**: User tests feature in production
5. **Clean Up**: If UAT passes, remove excessive logs (keep critical error logs)
6. **Done**: Feature is production-ready with minimal logging

### When to Keep vs. Remove Logs

**Keep Forever** (production logs):
- ‚ùå Errors and exceptions
- ‚ùå Security events (auth failures, permission denials)
- ‚ùå Business-critical operations (payments, data deletion)
- ‚ùå Performance metrics

**Remove After UAT** (debug logs):
- ‚úÖ "Step 1, Step 2, Step 3" progress logs
- ‚úÖ Intermediate calculation values
- ‚úÖ "Entering function X" / "Exiting function Y"
- ‚úÖ Verbose object dumps for debugging

### Structured Logging Format

Use consistent format for easy parsing:

```typescript
// Good: Structured and parseable
console.log('Action:', 'user_upload', {
  userId: '123',
  fileName: 'photo.jpg',
  fileSize: 2048000,
  timestamp: Date.now()
});

// Bad: Unstructured text blob
console.log('User 123 uploaded photo.jpg which is 2048000 bytes');
```

### Logging Anti-Patterns

**‚ùå Don't**:
- Log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Use `console.log()` for user-facing messages (use proper error handling)
- Log inside tight loops (causes performance issues)
- Mix logging with application logic (keep logs separate)
- Assume logs will always be available (add graceful degradation)

**‚úÖ Do**:
- Use semantic prefixes (`‚úÖ`, `‚ùå`, `‚ö†Ô∏è`, `üéØ`) for visual scanning
- Include context (what operation, what data, what state)
- Log before and after external calls
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add timestamps for performance debugging (Vercel adds these automatically)

### Integration with Development Workflow

**Updated Feature Development Cycle**:

```markdown
1. Plan feature (Plan Mode)
2. Implement with comprehensive logging
3. Deploy to Vercel
4. Claude checks logs (self-debug)
5. Fix issues if found
6. User UAT
7. If UAT passes: Clean up logs, redeploy
8. If UAT fails: Keep logs, fix issues, repeat from step 3
```

**SESSION_CHECKLIST.md Integration**:
- Add observability check before marking feature "done"
- Verify logs are accessible (Claude can read them)
- Confirm UAT passed before log cleanup

### Future Enhancements

**Phase 1** (current): Comprehensive console logging
**Phase 2** (future): Vercel API integration for programmatic log access
**Phase 3** (future): Structured logging service (Datadog, LogRocket, etc.)

**Decision Point**: Move to Phase 2/3 when:
- Console logging becomes insufficient (complex multi-function flows)
- Need historical log analysis (beyond Vercel's retention period)
- Multiple developers need log access

Until then: **Start Minimal** - console logs are sufficient.

## Session Structure

### Start of Session
1. Review `SESSION_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Decide what to build today
3. Read relevant `plan.md` if continuing work

### During Session
4. Use Plan Mode for non-trivial tasks
5. Externalize key decisions to markdown files
6. Capture mistakes immediately in `COMMON_MISTAKES.md`

### End of Session
7. Update `plan.md` with current state
8. Detail captured mistakes
9. Update process docs if patterns emerged
