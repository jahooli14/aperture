# Development Workflow

> **Version**: 1.0 - Based on Gemini deep research on agentic SDLC

## Core Principle: Plan First, Execute Second

Never go straight from idea to code for non-trivial tasks. **Separate thinking from doing**.

---

## Plan Mode Discipline

### When to Use Plan Mode (Mandatory)
- ‚úÖ Starting any new feature
- ‚úÖ Complex refactoring across multiple files
- ‚úÖ Debugging issues where root cause is unclear
- ‚úÖ Architectural decisions with broad impact

### When to Skip Plan Mode
- ‚ùå Simple bug fixes (< 5 lines changed)
- ‚ùå Boilerplate generation
- ‚ùå Minor styling tweaks
- ‚ùå Updating documentation only

### The Plan Mode Workflow

1. **Enter Plan Mode**: Press `Shift+Tab` twice in Claude Code
2. **Describe Goal**: High-level objective (not implementation details)
3. **Receive Plan**: Claude researches codebase and generates step-by-step plan
4. **Review & Refine**: üö® **NEVER accept first version**
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Challenge assumptions
   - Request modifications
   - Iterate until plan is robust
5. **Execute**: Exit Plan Mode and implement the agreed plan

### Plan Mode Example

**‚ùå Bad (No Planning)**:
```
User: "Add authentication to the app"
Claude: [starts generating auth code immediately]
```

**‚úÖ Good (Plan First)**:
```
User: [Shift+Tab twice]
User: "Add authentication to the app"
Claude: [generates plan]
User: "What about password reset flow? And social login?"
Claude: [refines plan]
User: "Perfect, let's execute"
Claude: [implements refined plan]
```

## The Reasoning Dial: Think Hard Hierarchy

Match AI thinking budget to task complexity. Higher levels = more thorough analysis but also higher cost and latency.

| Level | Keyword | Use Case | Example |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Default** | (none) | Routine tasks | "Add a loading spinner to the button" |
| **Level 1** | `think` | Straightforward features, simple bugs | "think about how to add pagination to the user list" |
| **Level 2** | `think hard` | Complex business logic, multi-component work | "think hard about implementing the checkout flow with state management" |
| **Level 3** | `think harder` | Performance optimization, security-critical code | "think harder about optimizing this database query for scale and security" |
| **Level 4** | `ultrathink` | Legacy system integration, "impossible" bugs, foundational architecture | "ultrathink about our migration plan from monolith to microservices" |

### Strategic Usage
- **Most work**: Default or `think` (fast, cost-effective)
- **Feature development**: `think hard` (workhorse mode)
- **Critical decisions**: `think harder` or `ultrathink` (high stakes only)

### Red Flag
If you find yourself using `ultrathink` frequently, you may have an architecture problem. Consider refactoring to reduce complexity.

## Socratic Questioning: Make Claude Ask Questions

The most common AI failure mode: **proceeding on flawed assumptions**.

### The Fix: Invert the Interaction

**Before Claude starts planning or coding**, make it ask questions:

```
"Before you start implementing user authentication,
ask me clarifying questions about the requirements."
```

### What Claude Should Ask
- Edge cases: "What happens if the user's email already exists?"
- Design decisions: "Do you want social login or just email/password?"
- Security: "What's the password strength policy?"
- Integration: "Should this integrate with the existing user management system?"

### When to Use
- ‚úÖ Starting any new feature
- ‚úÖ Implementing based on vague requirements
- ‚úÖ Working in unfamiliar parts of the codebase
- ‚úÖ Security or performance-critical code

## Memory Externalization: Write Plans to Disk

**Problem**: Chat history is ephemeral and limited by token count.

**Solution**: Persist critical artifacts to version-controlled markdown files.

### Essential Artifacts

| File | Purpose | When to Create |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **plan.md** | Step-by-step implementation plan with checkboxes | Start of feature work |
| **architecture.md** | System design, schemas, API contracts | Project setup or major refactor |
| **decisions.md** | Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) | Whenever making a significant choice |
| **todo.md** | Dynamic task checklist | Ongoing during development |

### Example Workflow

```
User: "Create a plan for the authentication system and save it to plan.md"
Claude: [generates detailed plan and writes to plan.md]

[Later, in a new session]
User: "Read plan.md and continue implementation from where we left off"
Claude: [picks up seamlessly from saved state]
```

### Why This Matters
- **Persistence**: Survives beyond single chat session
- **Shareability**: Other developers (or AI agents) can read it
- **Version Control**: Track evolution of plans and decisions
- **Foundation for Multi-Agent Work**: Shared state for parallel development

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) with AI

TDD is ideal for AI-augmented development. The tight feedback loop constrains the AI and ensures correctness.

### The AI-TDD Workflow

1. **Generate Tests First**
   ```
   "You are now in Test-Driven Development mode.
   Write comprehensive unit tests for the UserProfile component.
   The tests should fail initially."
   ```

2. **Confirm Failure**: Run tests, verify they fail as expected

3. **Implement to Pass**
   ```
   "Write the minimum code to make these tests pass.
   Do NOT modify the test files."
   ```

4. **Iterate**: Claude runs tests, adjusts code until green

5. **Refactor**: Once passing, improve code clarity

### Critical Constraint
**Always include**: "Do NOT modify the test files."

This prevents the AI from "cheating" by changing tests to fit a flawed implementation.

### Testing Constitution
Create `knowledge-base/testing/` directory with:
- `testing-core.md`: Universal rules (framework, mocking, naming)
- `testing-components.md`: React component patterns
- `testing-api.md`: API endpoint patterns

These files provide Claude with context for generating idiomatic tests.

---

## Git Workflow

### Commit Messages (Automated)
Use the `/commit` slash command to generate Conventional Commits:

```bash
git add .
# In Claude: /commit
# Result: "feat(auth): add email magic link authentication"
```

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `feature/[name]`: New features
- `fix/[name]`: Bug fixes
- `refactor/[name]`: Code improvements without behavior change

### PR Reviews (Automated)
Install the Claude Code GitHub App for automatic PR reviews. Configure in `claude-code-review.yml`:
```yaml
focus:
  - logic errors
  - security vulnerabilities
  - performance issues
ignore:
  - style nitpicks
  - minor formatting
```

---

## Development Commands

### Slash Commands
Store in `.claude/commands/` (see `.process/SLASH_COMMANDS.md` for full list)

Essential commands:
- `/commit`: Generate conventional commit message
- `/test`: Generate unit tests for a file
- `/qa`: Code quality review
- `/refactor`: Apply clean code principles

### Creating New Commands
When you write a complex prompt more than twice, convert it to a command:

```markdown
<!-- .claude/commands/api-endpoint.md -->
Generate a new API endpoint with the following:
1. TypeScript types for request/response
2. Input validation with Zod
3. Error handling
4. Unit tests

Endpoint: $ARGUMENTS
```

Usage: `/api-endpoint POST /api/users`

---

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- **Node.js**: >= 18
- **Package Manager**: npm (or pnpm for monorepos)
- **IDE**: VS Code (with Claude Code extension) or JetBrains
- **Git**: Version control
- **Claude Code CLI**: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

### Optional (for Flow State)
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Use when**:
- ‚úÖ Inner-loop development with active supervision
- ‚úÖ Trusted, routine tasks
- ‚úÖ Local environment with version control

**Avoid when**:
- ‚ùå Wide-ranging refactors
- ‚ùå Unfamiliar codebase areas
- ‚ùå Automated CI/CD
- ‚ùå Production operations

## Session Structure

### Start of Session
1. Review `SESSION_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Decide what to build today
3. Read relevant `plan.md` if continuing work

### During Session
4. Use Plan Mode for non-trivial tasks
5. Externalize key decisions to markdown files
6. Capture mistakes immediately in `COMMON_MISTAKES.md`

### End of Session
7. Update `plan.md` with current state
8. Detail captured mistakes
9. Update process docs if patterns emerged

---

## Context Window Management

### The Performance Problem

**Critical Issue**: AI performance degrades as context windows grow longer. Long conversations lead to:
- Slower response times
- Lower quality outputs  
- Higher token costs
- Degraded reasoning capability

### Start Fresh Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Fresh context > struggling with degraded performance.

#### When to Start a New Session

**Mandatory fresh start when**:
- ‚úÖ Starting a completely new feature or project
- ‚úÖ Switching to a different part of the codebase
- ‚úÖ Context window > 100K tokens used
- ‚úÖ Noticing degraded response quality
- ‚úÖ Planning major architectural changes

**Optional fresh start when**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Current task completed (natural break point)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Stuck on a problem (fresh perspective helps)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple tangential discussions (context pollution)

**Continue current session when**:
- ‚ùå In middle of implementing a plan
- ‚ùå Debugging with accumulated context
- ‚ùå Making small related changes
- ‚ùå Context < 50K tokens and performance good

### Session Handoff Protocol

**Before closing a session**:

1. **Update `NEXT_SESSION.md`**: Current state, next steps, decisions, blockers
2. **Update project `plan.md`**: Check off completed items, update current state
3. **Commit all changes**: Clean state for next session
4. **Quick session log**: What done, what's next, any blockers

### Starting a New Session

**Efficient onboarding (< 5 minutes)**:
1. Read `NEXT_SESSION.md` (always start here)
2. Read relevant `plan.md` (project-specific state)
3. Skim recent changes: `git log --oneline -10`
4. Quick context check: 1-2 key files if needed

**Don't**: Re-read entire conversation or try to load full context.

### Token Efficiency

- Bullet points over paragraphs
- Pointers to files over duplicating content
- Examples over lengthy explanations
- CLAUDE.md files: < 500 lines, use `<file_map>` pointers

### Context Health Metrics

| Metric | Healthy | Degrading | Start Fresh |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Token usage | < 50K | 50-100K | > 100K |
| Response quality | Clear, accurate | Occasional confusion | Frequent errors |
| Response time | Fast (< 10s) | Slower (10-30s) | Very slow (> 30s) |

**Anti-Pattern**: Don't spend 15min summarizing. Spend 5min updating NEXT_SESSION.md and plan.md.
