# Development Workflow

> **Version**: 2.0 - Optimized for CI philosophy (Start Minimal, Cost/Benefit)

## üö® CRITICAL: Context Window Management

> **üìç See `.claude/startup.md:10-41` for authoritative token budget policy and enforcement**

**Most important rule**: AI performance degrades as context grows. Fresh context > struggling with degraded performance.

### Quick Reference

| Token Usage | Status | Action |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| < 50K | ‚úÖ Healthy | Continue normally |
| 50-100K | ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning | Can I finish current task in < 50K more? If no ‚Üí fresh session |
| > 100K | üõë Critical | MANDATORY fresh session |

**For full decision tree and session handoff protocol** ‚Üí See `.claude/startup.md:10-41`

### Session Handoff Protocol

**üö® NEW RULE: Update NEXT_SESSION.md During Session, Not Just At End**

**When to update NEXT_SESSION.md**:
1. ‚úÖ **After completing a major phase** (don't wait until end)
2. ‚úÖ **After a breakthrough or pivot** (document immediately)
3. ‚úÖ **When changing approach** (update before proceeding)
4. ‚úÖ **Before closing session** (final update)

**Why this matters**:
- Prevents drift between documented plan and actual progress
- Ensures continuity if session runs out of tokens mid-work
- Fresh sessions can pick up exactly where you left off
- Captures breakthroughs while context is fresh

**Before closing a session**:
1. **Update `NEXT_SESSION.md`** (current state, next steps, blockers)
   - Remove completed phases
   - Add new next steps based on what you learned
   - Document any breakthroughs or pivots
2. Update project `plan.md` (check off completed items)
3. Commit all changes (clean state for next session)

**Starting a new session** (< 5 minutes):
1. Read `NEXT_SESSION.md` (always start here)
2. Read relevant `plan.md` (project-specific state)
3. Quick git check: `git log --oneline -10`

**DON'T**: Try to re-read entire conversation or reload full context.

## Core Principle: Plan First, Execute Second

Never go straight from idea to code for non-trivial tasks. **Separate thinking from doing**.

---

## Plan Mode Discipline

### When to Use Plan Mode (Mandatory)
- ‚úÖ Starting any new feature
- ‚úÖ Complex refactoring across multiple files
- ‚úÖ Debugging issues where root cause is unclear
- ‚úÖ Architectural decisions with broad impact

### When to Skip Plan Mode
- ‚ùå Simple bug fixes (< 5 lines changed)
- ‚ùå Boilerplate generation
- ‚ùå Minor styling tweaks
- ‚ùå Updating documentation only

### The Plan Mode Workflow

1. **Enter Plan Mode**: Press `Shift+Tab` twice in Claude Code
2. **Describe Goal**: High-level objective (not implementation details)
3. **Receive Plan**: Claude researches codebase and generates step-by-step plan
4. **Review & Refine**: üö® **NEVER accept first version**
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Challenge assumptions
   - Request modifications
   - Iterate until plan is robust
5. **Execute**: Exit Plan Mode and implement the agreed plan

### Plan Mode Example

**‚ùå Bad (No Planning)**:
```
User: "Add authentication to the app"
Claude: [starts generating auth code immediately]
```

**‚úÖ Good (Plan First)**:
```
User: [Shift+Tab twice]
User: "Add authentication to the app"
Claude: [generates plan]
User: "What about password reset flow? And social login?"
Claude: [refines plan]
User: "Perfect, let's execute"
Claude: [implements refined plan]
```

---

## Reasoning Modes (Simplified)

**Two modes - don't overthink it**:

| Mode | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Default** | 90% of work - routine tasks, features, bugs | "Add pagination to user list" |
| **think hard** | 10% of work - critical architecture, security, "impossible" bugs | "think hard about authentication system architecture" |

**Rule**: If unsure, use default. Claude adjusts reasoning automatically. Don't waste time deciding which thinking level to use.

**Red Flag**: If you're using `think hard` frequently, you may have an architecture problem - simplify the system.

---

## Socratic Questioning: Make Claude Ask Questions

The most common AI failure mode: **proceeding on flawed assumptions**.

### The Fix: Invert the Interaction

**Before Claude starts planning or coding**, make it ask questions:

```
"Before you start implementing user authentication,
ask me clarifying questions about the requirements."
```

### What Claude Should Ask
- Edge cases: "What happens if the user's email already exists?"
- Design decisions: "Do you want social login or just email/password?"
- Security: "What's the password strength policy?"
- Integration: "Should this integrate with the existing user management system?"

### When to Use
- ‚úÖ Starting any new feature
- ‚úÖ Implementing based on vague requirements
- ‚úÖ Working in unfamiliar parts of the codebase
- ‚úÖ Security or performance-critical code

---

## Memory Externalization: Write Plans to Disk

**Problem**: Chat history is ephemeral and limited by token count.

**Solution**: Persist critical artifacts to version-controlled markdown files.

### Essential Artifacts

| File | Purpose | When to Create |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **plan.md** | Step-by-step implementation plan with checkboxes | Start of feature work |
| **architecture.md** | System design, schemas, API contracts | Project setup or major refactor |
| **decisions.md** | Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) | Whenever making a significant choice |
| **todo.md** | Dynamic task checklist | Ongoing during development |

### Example Workflow

```
User: "Create a plan for the authentication system and save it to plan.md"
Claude: [generates detailed plan and writes to plan.md]

[Later, in a new session]
User: "Read plan.md and continue implementation from where we left off"
Claude: [picks up seamlessly from saved state]
```

### Why This Matters
- **Persistence**: Survives beyond single chat session
- **Shareability**: Other developers (or AI agents) can read it
- **Version Control**: Track evolution of plans and decisions
- **Foundation for Multi-Agent Work**: Shared state for parallel development

## Task List Standards

### Task Format with Verification Commands

**Every task in a checklist MUST include verification steps when applicable.**

**Template**:
```markdown
- [ ] <Action to take>
  - <Implementation detail 1>
  - <Implementation detail 2>
  - Verify: `<command to run>`
  - Expected: <what you should see>
  - If fail: <troubleshooting step>
```

**Examples**:

‚úÖ **GOOD** - Has verification:
```markdown
- [ ] Deploy new alignment function to Vercel
  - Update `api/align-photo-v4.ts` with coordinate scaling
  - Add Python subprocess call to OpenCV script
  - Verify: `git push origin main` triggers deployment
  - Verify: Deployment logs at vercel.com/deployments show success
  - Verify: `/vercel-logs align-photo 10` shows no errors
  - Expected: Logs show "Alignment completed in X seconds"
  - If fail: Check Vercel environment variables are set
```

‚ùå **BAD** - No verification:
```markdown
- [ ] Deploy new alignment function
```

### Task Update Rules

**When to update task lists**:
1. ‚úÖ After completing a task (mark with `[x]`)
2. ‚úÖ After discovering subtasks (add to list)
3. ‚úÖ When verification fails (add troubleshooting tasks)
4. ‚úÖ After major phases (update CLAUDE-APERTURE.md tasks section)

**Where to maintain tasks**:
- **CLAUDE-APERTURE.md** - High-level current sprint tasks (single source of truth)
- **NEXT_SESSION.md** - Detailed implementation steps for current work
- **TodoWrite tool** - Session-scoped ephemeral task tracking

### Verification Command Categories

**Build verification**:
```markdown
- Verify: `npm run build` succeeds
- Expected: No TypeScript errors, build output in dist/
```

**Deployment verification**:
```markdown
- Verify: `git push origin main` triggers Vercel deployment
- Verify: Deployment at vercel.com shows "Ready"
- Verify: `/vercel-logs [function] 10` shows successful execution
```

**Functional verification**:
```markdown
- Verify: Upload test photo via UI
- Expected: Photo processes in < 10 seconds
- Verify: Download aligned result and check eye positions
- Expected: Eyes at (360, 432) and (720, 432) ¬±5px
```

**Infrastructure verification**:
```markdown
- Verify: `/verify-infra wizard-of-oz` passes all checks
- Expected: ‚úÖ Database tables exist, ‚úÖ Storage buckets configured
```

## Decision Documentation & Source Citation

### When to Cite Sources

**Required for**:
- ‚úÖ Architectural decisions
- ‚úÖ Choosing between multiple approaches
- ‚úÖ Following documented patterns or protocols
- ‚úÖ Major refactoring decisions
- ‚úÖ Security or performance choices

**Not required for**:
- ‚ùå Simple bug fixes
- ‚ùå Minor style changes
- ‚ùå Boilerplate generation
- ‚ùå Documentation updates

### Citation Format

**Pattern**: `Based on <file_path:line_number>, which states "<quote>", I will <action>.`

**Examples**:

‚úÖ **Architectural Decision**:
```
Based on .process/ARCHITECTURE.md:45-52, which states "Start Minimal -
always ask what's the minimum viable implementation", I will implement
basic authentication with email/password only, deferring social login
until we validate the feature is needed.
```

‚úÖ **Following Debugging Protocol**:
```
Based on META_DEBUGGING_PROTOCOL.md:88-92, which states "verify inputs
before debugging algorithm", I'm first checking that eye coordinates are
scaled correctly before debugging the alignment transform logic.
```

‚úÖ **Pattern Compliance**:
```
Based on CLAUDE-APERTURE.md:151-158, which shows the pattern for separate
camera and gallery inputs, I will create two <input> elements with distinct
refs instead of a single input with conditional capture.
```

### Decision Records

**For major architectural choices, document in `.process/DECISION_LOG.md`**:

```markdown
## 2025-10-12 | Use Python OpenCV Instead of JavaScript Sharp

**Context**: Photo alignment requires affine transformation with rotation,
scale, and translation. JavaScript Sharp library doesn't support full affine
transforms.

**Decision**: Use Python OpenCV via subprocess, called from Node.js API.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Manual JavaScript coordinate math - REJECTED (error-prone, we tried this)
2. Sharp with manual rotation - REJECTED (insufficient - no translation)
3. Different JS library (jimp, canvas) - REJECTED (performance concerns)
4. Python OpenCV - SELECTED

**Rationale**:
- OpenCV has cv2.estimateAffinePartial2D - exactly what we need
- Well-tested, industry standard
- Python subprocess adds ~100ms overhead (acceptable)
- Eliminates error-prone manual coordinate tracking

**Source**: Research documented in NEXT_SESSION.md:Phase 3

**Consequences**:
- Adds Python runtime dependency to Vercel deployment
- Requires opencv-python-headless package
- Adds subprocess communication complexity (mitigated by simple API)
```

## Code Output Standards

### When to Show Full Files vs Use Edit Tool

**Show full file when**:
- File is < 200 lines after modification
- Creating a new file
- Major refactoring (> 30% of file changed)
- User explicitly requests full file

**Use Edit tool when**:
- File is > 200 lines and < 30% changed
- Precise single-function updates
- Small bug fixes (< 10 lines)
- Multiple small changes across large file

### Code Output Format

**Always include**:
1. File path with line numbers for references
2. Brief context: What changed and why
3. Verification step if applicable

**Example**:

```typescript
// projects/wizard-of-oz/api/align-photo-v4.ts

// CHANGE: Add coordinate scaling before passing to OpenCV
// WHY: Database stores coordinates for 768x1024 downscaled images,
//      must scale to actual image dimensions
// SOURCE: DEBUGGING_CHECKLIST.md:45-52

const scaleFactor = actualImageWidth / detectionImageWidth;
const scaledCoords = {
  leftEye: {
    x: dbCoords.leftEye.x * scaleFactor,
    y: dbCoords.leftEye.y * scaleFactor
  },
  rightEye: {
    x: dbCoords.rightEye.x * scaleFactor,
    y: dbCoords.rightEye.y * scaleFactor
  }
};

// Verify: Log dimensions to confirm scaling is correct
console.log(`Scaling coordinates: ${detectionImageWidth}px ‚Üí ${actualImageWidth}px (${scaleFactor}x)`);
```

### Code Comments Standards

**Required comments**:
- **WHY** the code exists (not WHAT it does - that should be obvious)
- Source citations for non-obvious patterns
- Edge case handling explanations
- Performance optimization rationale

**Avoid comments for**:
- Self-explanatory code
- Redundant descriptions of obvious operations
- Commented-out code (delete it)

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) with AI

TDD is ideal for AI-augmented development. The tight feedback loop constrains the AI and ensures correctness.

### The AI-TDD Workflow

1. **Generate Tests First**
   ```
   "You are now in Test-Driven Development mode.
   Write comprehensive unit tests for the UserProfile component.
   The tests should fail initially."
   ```

2. **Confirm Failure**: Run tests, verify they fail as expected

3. **Implement to Pass**
   ```
   "Write the minimum code to make these tests pass.
   Do NOT modify the test files."
   ```

4. **Iterate**: Claude runs tests, adjusts code until green

5. **Refactor**: Once passing, improve code clarity

### Critical Constraint
**Always include**: "Do NOT modify the test files."

This prevents the AI from "cheating" by changing tests to fit a flawed implementation.

### Testing Constitution
Create `knowledge-base/testing/` directory with:
- `testing-core.md`: Universal rules (framework, mocking, naming)
- `testing-components.md`: React component patterns
- `testing-api.md`: API endpoint patterns

These files provide Claude with context for generating idiomatic tests.

---

## Git Workflow

### Commit Messages (Automated)
Use the `/commit` slash command to generate Conventional Commits:

```bash
git add .
# In Claude: /commit
# Result: "feat(auth): add email magic link authentication"
```

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `feature/[name]`: New features
- `fix/[name]`: Bug fixes
- `refactor/[name]`: Code improvements without behavior change

### PR Reviews (Automated)
Install the Claude Code GitHub App for automatic PR reviews. Configure in `claude-code-review.yml`:
```yaml
focus:
  - logic errors
  - security vulnerabilities
  - performance issues
ignore:
  - style nitpicks
  - minor formatting
```

---

## Development Commands

### Slash Commands
Store in `.claude/commands/` (see `.process/SLASH_COMMANDS.md` for full list)

Essential commands:
- `/commit`: Generate conventional commit message
- `/test`: Generate unit tests for a file
- `/qa`: Code quality review
- `/refactor`: Apply clean code principles

### Creating New Commands
When you write a complex prompt more than twice, convert it to a command:

```markdown
<!-- .claude/commands/api-endpoint.md -->
Generate a new API endpoint with the following:
1. TypeScript types for request/response
2. Input validation with Zod
3. Error handling
4. Unit tests

Endpoint: $ARGUMENTS
```

Usage: `/api-endpoint POST /api/users`

---

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- **Node.js**: >= 18
- **Package Manager**: npm (or pnpm for monorepos)
- **IDE**: VS Code (with Claude Code extension) or JetBrains
- **Git**: Version control
- **Claude Code CLI**: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

### Optional (for Flow State)
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Use when**:
- ‚úÖ Inner-loop development with active supervision
- ‚úÖ Trusted, routine tasks
- ‚úÖ Local environment with version control

**Avoid when**:
- ‚ùå Wide-ranging refactors
- ‚ùå Unfamiliar codebase areas
- ‚ùå Automated CI/CD
- ‚ùå Production operations

---

## Observability & Logging

> **üìç Full guide ‚Üí `.process/OBSERVABILITY.md`**

**Core Principle**: Claude must NEVER ask users to check external logs. All debugging info must be accessible programmatically or through comprehensive in-code logging.

**Quick reference**:
- All new features need comprehensive logging
- Keep logs until UAT passes
- Use `/vercel-logs` for autonomous debugging
- See `.process/OBSERVABILITY.md` for requirements and examples

---

## Session Structure

### Start of Session
1. Review `SESSION_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Decide what to build today
3. Read relevant `plan.md` if continuing work

### During Session
4. Use Plan Mode for non-trivial tasks
5. Externalize key decisions to markdown files
6. Capture mistakes immediately in `COMMON_MISTAKES.md`

### End of Session
7. Update `plan.md` with current state
8. Detail captured mistakes
9. Update process docs if patterns emerged

---
