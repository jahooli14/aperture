## üéØ Current Status

### What We Just Completed (Session 2)

**Goal**: Deploy wizard-of-oz app to production and establish GitHub workflows

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Workflows**: Complete CI/CD setup with workflows and templates
- ‚úÖ **Wizard of Oz App**: ‚úÖ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION & WORKING!
  - Baby photo alignment with AI eye detection
  - Supabase database & storage configured
  - Gemini AI integration functional
  - Environment variables configured in Vercel
  - Authentication working with magic links
- ‚úÖ **Build Process**: Fixed all TypeScript and Tailwind errors
- ‚úÖ **Process Improvement**: Updated SESSION_CHECKLIST.md with feature development best practices
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Added deployment learnings to COMMON_MISTAKES.md

**Key Learnings**:
- **Test Builds Locally First**: Always run `npm run build` before pushing to catch errors early
- **Comprehensive Task Breakdown**: Need granular todos for complex features (updated SESSION_CHECKLIST.md)
- **Mobile Development**: Testing locally prevents inefficient mobile debugging loops

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Enhance Wizard of Oz App

**Feature options**:
- Video timelapse generation (FFmpeg integration)
- Daily reminder system (Vercel Cron jobs)
- Analytics dashboard (usage metrics, growth tracking)
- Smile/milestone detection (Gemini AI enhancement)
- Multi-child support
- Social sharing (Twitter, Instagram)
- Mobile app improvements

### Priority 2: New Project

**Start a new project** following the established patterns from wizard-of-oz

### Priority 3: Process Improvements

- Test GitHub deployment tracking workflow
