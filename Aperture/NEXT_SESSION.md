## üéØ Current Status

### What We Just Completed (Session 4 - CI Philosophy Audit & Process Improvements)

**Goal**: Apply "Start Minimal" CI philosophy to documentation itself

**Completed**: ‚úÖ **ALL 9 RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTED**
- ‚úÖ Pre-flight automation commands (verify-infra, which-project)
- ‚úÖ Token budget health check (SESSION_CHECKLIST step 0 + dashboard)
- ‚úÖ Simplified START_HERE.md decision tree (5min ‚Üí 1-2min)
- ‚úÖ Single task tracking system (TodoWrite ‚Üí NEXT_SESSION.md)
- ‚úÖ Simplified CONTRIBUTING.md (196 ‚Üí 24 lines, 88% reduction)
- ‚úÖ Restructured DEVELOPMENT.md (context first, 2-level reasoning)
- ‚úÖ Git hooks for conventional commits
- ‚úÖ Automated deployment protection check

- **Documentation Load**: ~50% reduction in token overhead
- **Quality**: Proactive token management, enforced standards, single source of truth

**Created Files**:
- `.claude/commands/verify-infra.md` - Infrastructure checklist (DB, storage, env vars, Vercel)
- `.claude/commands/which-project.md` - Auto-detect NUDJ vs Aperture
- `.claude/commands/token-health.md` - Visual context window dashboard
- `.scripts/commit-msg` - Git hook enforcing Conventional Commits
- `.scripts/install-hooks.sh` - Easy hook installation
- `CI_PHILOSOPHY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Complete implementation summary

**Modified Files**:
- `START_HERE.md` - Task-appropriate startup paths, no more mandatory 5-step
- `SESSION_CHECKLIST.md` - Token check step 0, pre-flight checks, single tracking
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Minimal 24-line version for personal project
- `.process/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Context management first, simplified reasoning dial
- `.process/COMMON_MISTAKES.md` - Added documentation philosophy entry

**Impact Estimate**: 10-20 hours saved over next 10 sessions

### Previous Session (Session 3 - Mobile Optimization & Alignment Debugging)

**Goal**: Enable alignment pipeline and optimize mobile UX

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ **Upload Functionality Fixed**
  - Removed non-existent `/api/detect-eyes` call that was blocking uploads
  - Fixed file reference persistence issue (stored in state)
  - Added timeout handling (30s) for upload debugging
  - Removed daily upload limit for testing (both code & database constraint)

- ‚úÖ **Mobile-First UI Optimization**
  - Touch-optimized buttons (min 44-48px height)
  - Photo info overlay always visible on mobile (no hover needed)
  - Removed debug log UI for cleaner production interface
  - Sticky header, responsive text sizing
  - Active states for mobile, hover for desktop
  - Image lazy loading for performance

- ‚úÖ **Alignment Pipeline Re-enabled**
  - Re-connected detect-eyes API call after upload
  - Fixed absolute URL issues for production (window.location.origin)
  - Fixed VERCEL_URL missing `https://` protocol
  - Added comprehensive logging throughout pipeline

- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure Setup**
  - Created STORAGE_BUCKET_SETUP.md with detailed instructions
  - Documented need for 'originals' and 'aligned' buckets
  - Verified environment variables in Vercel

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED** ‚úÖ:
- ‚úÖ Eye detection works (eye_coordinates populated in database)
- ‚úÖ All APIs working correctly
- ‚ùå **Vercel Deployment Protection** blocking server-to-server API calls
- detect-eyes ‚Üí align-photo call gets HTML authentication page instead of API response
- **Fix**: Disable Deployment Protection in Vercel Settings for this project

**Key Learnings**:
- **Infrastructure First**: Always verify buckets/tables exist before debugging code
- **Absolute URLs in Production**: Relative paths don't work in Vercel serverless functions
- **VERCEL_URL Gotcha**: Environment variable doesn't include `https://` protocol
- **Silent Failures**: Fire-and-forget API calls hide all errors - always check responses
- **Database Constraints**: They enforce even when code doesn't check
- **Empty Vercel Logs**: Mean function exited early, not that it succeeded silently

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: SETUP NEW WORKFLOW TOOLS (5 min - DO THIS FIRST)

**Install git hooks**:
```bash
cd /Users/dancroome-horgan/Documents/GitHub/Aperture
./.scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

**Test new commands**:
```bash
# Token health check (use at start of every session)
/token-health

# Infrastructure verification (use before debugging)
/verify-infra wizard-of-oz

# Project detection (if ever unsure)
/which-project
```

**Read updated docs**:
- `START_HERE.md` - New decision tree for startup
- `SESSION_CHECKLIST.md` - Token check is now step 0
- `CI_PHILOSOPHY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Full summary of changes

### Priority 2: FINISH ALIGNMENT PIPELINE (5-15 min)

**Current state**:
- User uploaded photos with new logging
- Need to check Vercel logs for align-photo to see where it's failing

**Most likely issues**:
1. **Sharp dependency missing** in production build
2. **Storage bucket permission error** (aligned bucket exists but may lack policies)
3. **Image processing timeout** (photos too large for serverless function)
4. **Service role key issue** (can't write to storage or database)

**Next steps**:
1. Check Vercel logs for align-photo function - should now show detailed logging
2. Look for specific error: storage upload, Sharp processing, or database update
3. Fix the specific issue identified
4. Test with one upload
5. Verify aligned_url gets populated and gallery shows "‚úì Aligned"

**Files to check if needed**:
- `projects/wizard-of-oz/api/align-photo.ts` - Has comprehensive logging now
- `projects/wizard-of-oz/api/detect-eyes.ts` - Logs align-photo response status
- Supabase Storage ‚Üí aligned bucket ‚Üí Policies tab

### Priority 2: Clean Up Debug Code (10 min)

Once alignment works:
1. Remove excessive console.log statements from production
2. Remove error details display from UploadPhoto.tsx
3. Re-enable daily upload limit (code + database constraint)
4. Remove visible error JSON from UI

### Priority 3: Test Complete Flow (5 min)

1. Upload baby photo
2. Wait 15 seconds
3. Refresh page
4. Verify "‚úì Aligned" appears
5. Check aligned bucket has file
6. Test with multiple photos

## üîë Key Context for Next Session

### Important Configuration

**Wizard of Oz App**:
- **Status**: üü° PARTIALLY WORKING
  - ‚úÖ Upload works
  - ‚úÖ Eye detection works
  - ‚ùå Photo alignment incomplete
- **Vercel URL**: (User has this)
- **Repository Path**: `Aperture/projects/wizard-of-oz`
- **Vercel Root Directory**: `Aperture/projects/wizard-of-oz`
- **Supabase URL**: `https://zaruvcwdqkqmyscwvxci.supabase.co`

**Environment Variables (Vercel)**:
- ‚úÖ `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- ‚úÖ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `GEMINI_API_KEY`

**Database State**:
- ‚úÖ `photos` table exists with data
- ‚úÖ Unique constraint on (user_id, upload_date) REMOVED for testing
- ‚úÖ eye_coordinates column populated (Gemini AI working)
- ‚ùå aligned_url column NULL (alignment failing)

**Storage Buckets**:
- ‚úÖ `originals` - exists, public, has uploaded photos
- ‚úÖ `aligned` - exists, public, EMPTY (alignment not completing)

### Files That Matter Most

**For debugging alignment**:
- `projects/wizard-of-oz/api/detect-eyes.ts` - Entry point, calls align-photo
- `projects/wizard-of-oz/api/align-photo.ts` - Sharp image processing
- `projects/wizard-of-oz/STORAGE_BUCKET_SETUP.md` - Bucket setup guide
- `.process/COMMON_MISTAKES.md` - Updated with Vercel debugging patterns

**For reference**:
- `projects/wizard-of-oz/src/stores/usePhotoStore.ts` - Frontend upload logic
- `projects/wizard-of-oz/src/components/PhotoGallery.tsx` - Shows processing status

### Known Issues / Tech Debt

**Active Issues**:
1. **Alignment pipeline incomplete** - align-photo returning 200 but not completing
2. **Excessive debug logging** - Need to clean up before production use
3. **Daily upload limit disabled** - Database constraint removed for testing

**Code Cleanup Needed**:
- Remove console.log statements from production code
- Simplify error messages in UploadPhoto.tsx
- Re-add unique constraint after testing complete

## üöÄ Quick Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Check current state
cd /Users/dancroome-horgan/Documents/GitHub/Aperture
git status
git log --oneline -10

# Check Vercel logs
# Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Logs tab
# Look for align-photo function logs

# Check database state
# Supabase ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí photos
# Look at eye_coordinates and aligned_url columns

# Check storage state
# Supabase ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí aligned bucket
# Should be empty (problem) or have files (working)

# If alignment fixed, clean up:
# 1. Remove console.logs from api/*.ts files
# 2. Simplify UploadPhoto.tsx error display
# 3. Re-add database constraint:
#    ALTER TABLE photos ADD CONSTRAINT photos_user_id_upload_date_key UNIQUE (user_id, upload_date);
```

## üí° Tips for Next Session

**Do**:
- ‚úÖ Check Vercel logs FIRST - should have detailed output now
- ‚úÖ Look for specific error in align-photo logs
- ‚úÖ Fix the ONE remaining issue
- ‚úÖ Clean up debug code once working
- ‚úÖ Start fresh context (we're at 124K tokens)

**Don't**:
- ‚ùå Add more logging (already comprehensive)
- ‚ùå Redeploy without checking logs first
- ‚ùå Debug code before checking infrastructure
- ‚ùå Assume 200 response means success

---

## üìù Debugging Checklist (if alignment still broken)

If align-photo still fails next session:

1. **Check Vercel Logs** - Should show detailed execution path
2. **Look for these specific errors**:
   - "Sharp is not defined" ‚Üí Missing dependency
   - "Storage upload error" ‚Üí Bucket permission issue
   - "Database update error" ‚Üí RLS policy issue
   - "Timeout" ‚Üí Image too large for serverless
3. **Check align-photo entry point** - Should log "align-photo called with..."
4. **Check if Sharp processing starts** - Should log "Processing alignment for photo..."
5. **Check storage upload attempt** - Should log "Uploading aligned image to bucket..."
6. **Check database update** - Should log "Updating database with aligned URL..."
7. **Look for success** - Should log "‚úÖ Alignment complete"

If no logs appear at all:
- align-photo isn't being reached
- Check detect-eyes logs for "Calling align-photo API" and response status
- Verify URL being called is correct

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-10 (End of Session 3)
**Next Session Goal**: Fix alignment pipeline (1 blocker), clean up debug code
**Estimated Time**: 15-30 minutes in fresh context
**Token Budget**: Start fresh (this session exhausted)
