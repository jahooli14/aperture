  "decision": "rejected",
  "reasoning": [
    "The new article is a high-level summary of a video, not a detailed guide or specific design philosophy.",
    "It lacks concrete examples, code snippets, or specific implementation steps relevant to 'Tool Design Philosophy'.",
    "It does not provide quantifiable benefits or specific data to support its claims.",
    "The source (devto-ai, authority 0.6) is not as authoritative as Anthropic, which is the source for the existing documentation.",
    "The content is too generic to add concrete value to the existing, highly specific 'Tool Design Philosophy' section, which includes specific code examples and actionable advice."
