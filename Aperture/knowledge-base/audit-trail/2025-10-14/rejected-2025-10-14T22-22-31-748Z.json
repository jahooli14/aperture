  "decision": "rejected",
  "reasoning": [
    "The new article's excerpt is highly generic, discussing what the guide 'will cover' rather than providing specific design principles, code examples, or actionable advice relevant to 'Tool Design Philosophy'.",
    "It lacks concrete examples, quantifiable benefits, or specific implementation details that would enhance the existing, highly specific documentation.",
    "The source (devto-ai, Tech With Tim) is not considered as authoritative for design philosophy as the existing Anthropic source.",
    "None of the scores meet the 0.7 threshold for merging, and it does not add concrete value to the existing content."
