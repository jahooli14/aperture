  "decision": "rejected",
  "reasoning": [
    "The provided 'New Article' content is an introductory summary/advertisement for a video/guide, not the detailed content itself. It lacks any specific examples, code, or actionable advice.",
    "It does not offer concrete examples or quantifiable benefits that would enhance the existing 'Tool Design Philosophy' section.",
    "The existing documentation is highly specific, implementable, and sourced from Anthropic, directly addressing tool design philosophy with examples. The new article's provided text is too generic to compare meaningfully or add value to this section.",
    "While 'Tech With Tim' is a credible source for tutorials, it is not as authoritative for foundational 'Tool Design Philosophy' as Anthropic's engineering blog, especially given the lack of specific content in the provided text."
