  "reasoning": [
    "The new article is a high-level summary of a video, not detailed content. It lists topics but provides no specific examples, code, or actionable steps relevant to tool design philosophy.",
    "It does not offer quantifiable benefits or specific evidence to support design principles.",
    "The source 'Tech With Tim' is a credible educational channel, but not an authoritative research institution like Anthropic for AI agent tool design philosophy.",
    "The content focuses on 'how to build AI agents' generally, rather than specific 'tool design philosophy' which is the focus of the existing document. It does not add concrete value to the existing section's specific guidance on tool quality, targeting, output design, or error handling."
