  "decision": "rejected",
  "reasoning": [
    "The new article discusses specific OpenAI products (Agentkit, Apps SDK) and their general capabilities, which is not directly relevant to the 'Tool Design Philosophy' section's focus on principles for *how to design* effective tools.",
    "It provides no specific design principles, code examples, or actionable guidance that would enhance the existing documentation's detailed advice on tool quality, targeted operations, high-signal output, or error handling.",
    "The content is high-level and promotional, lacking the specificity, implementability, and strong evidence (e.g., benchmarks, studies) required to improve a technical design philosophy document.",
    "It does not add concrete value to the existing content, which focuses on *how* to build good tools, not *what* tools are available."
