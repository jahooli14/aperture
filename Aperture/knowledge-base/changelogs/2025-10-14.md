## Rejected Findings


### 1. Tech With Tim: How to Build AI Agents in Python
**Reason**: The new article is a high-level promotional summary for a YouTube video, not a detailed guide on tool design philosophy.; It provides no specific examples, code, or actionable advice that could enhance the existing documentation's concrete examples for 'Targeted Operations' or 'High-Signal Output Design'.; The content is generic ('essential building blocks', 'popular Python frameworks', 'common design patterns') and lacks the specificity required to be implementable or to add value to the existing, detailed principles.; The source (dev.to blog summarizing a YouTube channel) is not considered authoritative for design philosophy compared to the existing Anthropic engineering source.; It does not offer any quantifiable benefits related to tool design or agent performance.; While it doesn't contradict existing content, it also doesn't add any concrete value or specific details.
**Quality scores**: Specificity 0.00, Implementability 0.00, Evidence 0.00
