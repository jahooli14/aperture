## Rejected Findings


### 1. Tech With Tim: How to Build AI Agents in Python
**Reason**: The new article is a high-level summary of a video, not a detailed guide or specific design philosophy.; It lacks concrete examples, code snippets, or specific implementation steps relevant to 'Tool Design Philosophy'.; It does not provide quantifiable benefits or specific data to support its claims.; The source (devto-ai, authority 0.6) is not as authoritative as Anthropic, which is the source for the existing documentation.; The content is too generic to add concrete value to the existing, highly specific 'Tool Design Philosophy' section, which includes specific code examples and actionable advice.
**Quality scores**: Specificity 0.00, Implementability 0.00, Evidence 0.00


### 2. Krish Naik: Advanced Agentic RAG And Its Types New Series-Generative AI
**Reason**: The new article is purely promotional material for a course and does not contain any technical content, design philosophy, or examples relevant to the 'Tool Design Philosophy' section.; It offers no specific guidance, implementable code, or evidence-backed information that could enhance the existing documentation.; The existing documentation is already highly specific, implementable, and sourced from a primary authority (Anthropic) on agent tool design.
**Quality scores**: Specificity 0.00, Implementability 0.00, Evidence 0.00
