# üö¶ CLAUDE.md - Project Router

> **üß≠ You are here**: Project Router
>
> **Purpose**: Distinguish NUDJ (work) vs Aperture (personal) projects
>
> **Note**: `.claude/startup.md` is auto-read every session and handles session initialization. This file helps you choose the right project documentation.

## Which CLAUDE.md Should You Use?

### üè¢ Working on NUDJ (Work Projects)?

**Read this file**: **`CLAUDE-NUDJ.md`**

This includes:
- Nudj monorepo (apps/api, apps/admin, apps/user)
- @nudj-digital packages
- PNPM workspaces with Turbo
- MongoDB with gamification features
- Multi-tenant SaaS platform

### üè† Working on Aperture (Personal Projects)?

**Read this file**: **`CLAUDE-APERTURE.md`**

This includes:
- Wizard of Oz (baby photo app)
- Personal experiments and prototypes
- Individual Vercel deployments
- Supabase backends

---

## üìñ Lazy Loading Strategy

**IMPORTANT**: Don't read entire docs upfront. Use task-based navigation.

**Navigation Tools**:
- `NAVIGATION.md` - Task-based index (implementation, review, modification)
- `.process/WHEN_TO_READ.md` - Meta-guide for when to read what

**Examples**:
- Implementing feature ‚Üí Read CLAUDE-{PROJECT}.md ‚Üí Tool Design section
- Debugging ‚Üí Read .process/COMMON_MISTAKES.md
- Modifying autonomous docs ‚Üí Read scripts/autonomous-docs/FEATURE_GUIDE.md

## How to Tell Which Project You're On

### Check the User's Request
- **Work keywords**: Nudj, admin app, user app, API, MongoDB, gamification, challenges, rewards
- **Personal keywords**: Aperture, wizard-of-oz, baby photos, Supabase, autonomous docs

### Check Current Directory
```bash
# If you see these directories ‚Üí NUDJ (work)
apps/api/, apps/admin/, apps/user/, packages/database/

# If you see these directories ‚Üí Aperture (personal)
projects/wizard-of-oz/, scripts/autonomous-docs/
```

### Check git remote
```bash
# NUDJ (work)
git remote -v
# ‚Üí github.com/nudj-digital/monorepo

# Aperture (personal)
git remote -v
# ‚Üí github.com/jahooli14/aperture
```

## Autonomous Documentation System

**Aperture projects include self-optimizing documentation**:
- Updates daily at 09:00 UTC with latest AI/Claude best practices
- **Replaces** outdated content (not additive)
- Optimizes for token efficiency
- Modes: REPLACE (supersede), MERGE (consolidate), REFACTOR (compress), NEW (add)

**When docs update**: Check `knowledge-base/changelogs/` for what changed
**Modifying system**: See `scripts/autonomous-docs/FEATURE_GUIDE.md`

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Is the user asking about:
‚îú‚îÄ Nudj platform, admin interface, gamification?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Use CLAUDE-NUDJ.md
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Wizard of Oz, baby photos, Aperture?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Use CLAUDE-APERTURE.md
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ Not sure?
   ‚îî‚îÄ Ask the user which project they're working on
```

## Important Notes

1. **Never mix documentation** - NUDJ and Aperture have completely different structures
2. **Always confirm** - If unclear, ask the user before proceeding
3. **Read the right file** - Using wrong docs will cause confusion and errors

## üß≠ Navigation

**After determining project type**:

**If NUDJ (work)** ‚Üí Read `CLAUDE-NUDJ.md`
**If Aperture (personal)** ‚Üí Read `CLAUDE-APERTURE.md`

**Note**: `.claude/startup.md` handles automatic session startup sequence. This router just helps you pick the right project documentation.
