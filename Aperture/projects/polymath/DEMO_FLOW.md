## üí° Key Talking Points

### Cross-Domain Synthesis
"Most note-taking apps just store data. Polymath CONNECTS it - finding unexpected combinations between your work AND life."

### Real AI, Not Templates
"What you just watched wasn't a demo database - that was real AI synthesis using Google Gemini, analyzing your actual memory patterns."

### Personal Knowledge Graph
"Your memories become nodes. AI finds edges. Projects emerge from the network."

### Insight Engine vs Data Collector
"We're not collecting more data - we're mining what you already have for hidden patterns."

## üö® Demo Tips

### Before Demo
1. ‚úÖ Database loaded with 8 memories, 0 suggestions
2. ‚úÖ Clear browser cache to see fresh load
3. ‚úÖ Test "Generate Ideas" button works

### During Demo
- **Let progress bar complete** - don't skip the synthesis wait
- **Show memory themes first** - establish diverse inputs
- **Point out specific examples** - "parenting + React = Learning Platform"
- **Emphasize wildcards** - "Neural Sourdough shows it explores weird connections"

### After Demo
- Show how to clear demo data (banner)
- Explain Audiopen webhook setup for real use
- Mention 5-10 memories recommended to start

## üéØ Success Metrics

**You know the demo worked if**:
- Viewer says "whoa" during Generate Ideas
- They ask "how did it connect those?"
- They want to try it with their own memories
- They see the value vs Notion/Obsidian

**Demo killer line**:
"Your memory graph already exists - in your head, scattered across voice notes. Polymath just makes it visible and actionable."
