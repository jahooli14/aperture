## ✅ What Was Deployed

### Backend APIs
- ✅ `/api/projects/daily-queue` - 5-dimensional scoring algorithm
- ✅ `/api/projects/daily-context` - User context management
- ✅ Scoring dimensions: momentum, staleness, freshness, alignment, unlock

### Frontend
- ✅ `/today` route - Daily Actionable Queue page
- ✅ Context input dialog (time/energy/location)
- ✅ Project cards with category badges
- ✅ Category display: 🔥 Hot Streak, ⚠️ Needs Attention, ✨ Fresh Energy
- ✅ Skip actions & empty states

### Types & Schema
- ✅ Extended Project type with queue fields
- ✅ UserContext, ProjectScore, DailyQueueResponse types
- ✅ Updated ProjectStatus to include 'abandoned'

### Documentation
- ✅ DAILY_ACTIONABLE_QUEUE.md (complete spec)
- ✅ MEMORY_ENHANCEMENTS.md (6 improvements)
- ✅ PROJECT_ENHANCEMENTS.md (4 improvements)
- ✅ CROSS_PILLAR_IMPROVEMENTS.md (3 improvements)
- ✅ RUN_MIGRATION.md (instructions)

## ⚠️ Database Migration Required

**IMPORTANT:** The app is deployed but database migration is NOT yet run.

The `/today` page will work but with limited functionality until migration runs.

### To Complete Setup:

1. **Run Migration:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
   # - Go to https://nxkysxgaujdimrubjiln.supabase.co
   # - SQL Editor → Paste migration-daily-queue.sql → Run

   # Option 2: Command Line
   psql $SUPABASE_DB_URL < migration-daily-queue.sql
   ```

2. **Verify:**
   - Check `projects` table has new columns
   - Check `user_daily_context` table exists
   - Visit https://pupils-chppwkt4v-daniels-projects-ca7c7923.vercel.app/today

3. **Test:**
   - Open /today route
   - Should see empty state or projects if they exist
   - Edit context → Queue updates
   - Skip project → Removed from queue

## 🎯 How It Works

### Scoring Algorithm

Each project gets scored across 5 dimensions (0-100 points total):

1. **Momentum** (0-30 pts)
   - Worked on yesterday = 30 pts
   - Worked on 2 days ago = 25 pts
   - Within last week = 15 pts

2. **Staleness** (0-25 pts)
   - 14-30 days idle = 25 pts (sweet spot)
   - 7-14 days idle = 15 pts
   - 30-60 days = 10 pts (probably dying)

3. **Freshness** (0-20 pts)
   - 0-3 days old = 20 pts (brand new)
   - 4-7 days old = 15 pts
   - 8-14 days old = 10 pts

4. **Alignment** (0-20 pts)
   - Energy match = 10 pts
   - Time match = 5 pts
   - Context match = 5 pts

5. **Unlock Bonus** (0-5 pts)
   - Recently unblocked = 5 pts

### Queue Selection

After scoring, selects max 3 projects:
1. **Hot Streak** - Highest momentum (worked on recently)
2. **Needs Attention** - Highest staleness (getting stale)
3. **Fresh Energy** - Highest freshness (new/exciting)

Falls back to highest total score if categories don't fill.

## 🎨 Anti-Overwhelm Design

- **Max 3 Projects** - Never shows more than 3
- **Clear Reasons** - Each project shows WHY it's suggested
- **Skip Options** - "Skip Today" button (no guilt)
- **Empty States** - Helpful guidance when no projects match
- **Context Aware** - Respects user's time/energy/location

---

## 📊 Current State

### Working Without Migration
- ✅ Page loads
- ✅ Navigation works
- ✅ UI renders
- ⚠️ Queue always empty (no context table)
- ⚠️ Context save fails (no table)

### After Migration
- ✅ Full queue functionality
- ✅ Context persistence
- ✅ Scoring algorithm active
- ✅ Project filtering works

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)
1. Run `migration-daily-queue.sql` on Supabase
2. Test /today route works with real data
3. Verify context saves properly

### Optional (Future Enhancements)
See `NEXT_SESSION.md` for full roadmap:
- Phase 2: Memory Decay & Collision Detection (8-10h)
- Phase 3: Project Graveyard & Capability Freshness (10-12h)
- Phase 4: Cross-Pillar Features (6-8h)
- Phase 5: Context Windows & Synthesis Notes (8-10h)
