## 📖 What You're Looking At

This is **Polymath**, a meta-creative synthesis engine that:

1. **Captures your interests** via voice notes (Audiopen) → extracts themes and topics
2. **Scans your codebase** → identifies technical capabilities you already have
3. **AI synthesis** → generates novel project ideas at the intersection
4. **Activity learning** → tracks what you build → strengthens relevant nodes → influences future suggestions
5. **Knowledge graph** → builds connections between interests, capabilities, and projects

A creative feedback loop that gets smarter as you use it.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### MemoryOS (Existing System)
**What**: Personal knowledge graph from voice notes
**How**: Voice → Entities → Bridges → Insights
**Why**: Strengthen biological memory, surface forgotten connections

### Polymath (New System)
**What**: Meta-creative synthesis engine
**How**: Capabilities × Interests → AI generates project ideas → Activity strengthens nodes
**Why**: Generate creative possibilities at intersection of your skills and interests

### Integration (Bidirectional)
```
MemoryOS → Polymath
  Interests from memories feed project suggestions

Polymath → MemoryOS
  Active projects become entities in knowledge graph
```

## 🔑 Key Features

### Synthesis Algorithm
- Combines 2 capabilities at a time (e.g., "Supabase auth" + "AI face detection")
- AI generates project idea (e.g., "Baby Photo Timeline with Face Recognition")
- Scores on 3 dimensions:
  - **Novelty** (30%): How unique is this combination?
  - **Feasibility** (40%): Can you actually build this?
  - **Interest** (30%): Does it match your interests from MemoryOS?
- Total points = weighted average × 100

### Diversity Injection
- Every 4th suggestion is a "wild card" 🎲
- Deliberately outside your usual range
- Prevents echo chamber / filter bubble
- Encourages serendipitous exploration

### Activity-Based Learning
- Git commits → Map to projects → Map to capabilities
- Active capabilities strengthen (+0.05 per day)
- Unused capabilities decay (-0.01 per day)
- Stronger capabilities appear in more suggestions
- System learns what you actually work on (not just rate)

### Permanent Ideas List
- All suggestions tracked forever
- Statuses: pending, spark, meh, built, dismissed, saved
- Can revisit dismissed ideas later
- Can build from old sparks
- Full history of creative exploration

## 🚨 Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to migrate MemoryOS data?
**A**: No. Polymath adds new tables, doesn't touch existing ones.

### Q: Can I use MemoryOS without Polymath?
**A**: Yes. All MemoryOS functionality unchanged.

### Q: Can I test Polymath without AI API keys?
**A**: Yes. Use `seed-test-data.ts` to create test suggestions.

### Q: Will this cost money?
**A**: Minimal. Synthesis costs ~$0.10/week (Claude API). Embeddings ~$0.01/week (OpenAI).

### Q: Is this multi-user?
**A**: No. Single-user system (you). Could be extended later.

### Q: What if I don't want certain suggestions?
**A**: Rate them "meh" (👎) and the system learns. Those capability combinations get penalized.
