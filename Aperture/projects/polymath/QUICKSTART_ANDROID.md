## 📱 Install on Android (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Java (One-time, 2 minutes)

```bash
brew install openjdk@17
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/bin:$PATH"
source ~/.zshrc
```

Verify it worked:
```bash
java -version
# Should show: openjdk version "17.x.x"
```

### Step 2: Build the APK (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/dancroome-horgan/Documents/GitHub/Aperture/projects/polymath
./build-android.sh
```

This will:
1. Build your web app
2. Sync with Android
3. Create APK at: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

### Step 3: Install on Your Phone

**Option A: Copy APK to phone** (Easiest)
1. Copy `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` to your phone
   - Via USB, email, cloud storage, AirDrop, etc.
2. On your phone: Settings → Security → Enable "Install unknown apps" for your file manager
3. Open the APK file on your phone
4. Tap "Install"

**Option B: Use ADB** (Fastest)
```bash
# Enable USB debugging on phone:
# Settings → About Phone → Tap "Build Number" 7 times
# Settings → Developer Options → Enable USB Debugging

# Connect phone via USB, then:
adb install -r android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```
