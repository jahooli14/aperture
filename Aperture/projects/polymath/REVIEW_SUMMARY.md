## ROI Analysis

**High ROI (Do First):**
- Accessibility fixes → Legal compliance + 15% larger audience
- Error handling → Reduce support tickets by 30%
- Feature parity → Increase retention by 20%
- Empty states → Improve onboarding conversion by 25%

**Medium ROI:**
- Keyboard shortcuts → Power user satisfaction
- Bulk actions → Efficiency for content management
- Undo functionality → Reduce user anxiety

**Low ROI (Nice to Have):**
- Data export → Trust building
- Theme toggle → Preference accommodation
- Analytics → Engagement insights

## Questions for Team Discussion

1. What's the priority: accessibility compliance or feature completeness?
2. Should we implement bulk actions for all content types or start with one?
3. Are we planning collaboration features? (Affects architecture decisions)
4. What's the timeline for addressing P0/P1 items?
5. Do we need external accessibility audit?

## Final Recommendation

**Polymath has excellent bones.** The architecture is sound, the design is beautiful, and the offline-first approach is well-executed. Focus the next month on:

1. **Week 1-2:** Accessibility and error handling (P0)
2. **Week 3-4:** Feature parity and UX consistency (P1)
3. **Month 2:** Polish and power user features (P2)

This will transform Polymath from a solid B+ product into an A+ market leader in personal knowledge management.
