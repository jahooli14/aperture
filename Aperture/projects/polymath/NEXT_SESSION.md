## ‚úÖ Recently Completed (Continued Session)

### Thought Experience Improvements - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

Based on user feedback: "there is no full page view of the thought" and "'the speaker...' feels impersonal"

**1. Expandable Thought Cards**
- Added "Show more/Show less" toggle for long thoughts (>200 chars)
- Removed line-clamp-4 truncation when expanded
- Smooth transitions with chevron icons
- Touch-friendly controls matching app design language
- File: `src/components/MemoryCard.tsx`

**2. Personalized AI Voice**
- Updated Gemini prompt to write in **first-person**
- Matches "Going Analogue" tone: introspective, conversational, wry, philosophical
- Produces thoughts like "I've been thinking..." instead of "The speaker discussed..."
- File: `api/memories.ts`

**3. Consistent Terminology**
- Updated all user-facing text: "memories" ‚Üí "thoughts"
- Navigation label, page titles, error messages, toasts
- Files: App.tsx, HomePage.tsx, MemoriesPage.tsx, InsightsPage.tsx, SuggestionsPage.tsx
- Internal code (variables, types) unchanged for stability

**Build Status**: ‚úÖ Zero TypeScript errors, 6.22s build time
**Commits**: 2 new commits pushed to origin/main

## ‚úÖ Previously Completed Sessions

### Reading Queue Feature - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

A production-ready article reading system with excellent UX, comparable to Pocket/Instapaper.

**Commits (in order):**
1. `fix(reading): simplify to use Jina AI exclusively` - Removed Readability/JSDOM for serverless
2. `fix(reading): move sanitization to client-side` - DOMPurify in ReaderPage
3. `fix(vercel): add client-side routing support` - Fixed 404s
4. `fix(reading): remove incorrect URL encoding in Jina AI call` - Fixed empty content
5. `fix(reading): add error boundary and defensive error handling` - Fixed blank screens
6. `fix(reading): add defensive date validation to prevent crashes` - Fixed invalid dates
7. `fix(reading): correct Jina AI response parsing to extract content` - Fixed JSON structure
8. `feat(reading): convert Jina AI markdown to HTML for better readability` - Added marked library
9. `feat(reading): rename 'All' to 'Queue' and exclude archived articles` - Better UX

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ Save articles by URL with Jina AI extraction
- ‚úÖ Markdown-to-HTML conversion for clean rendering
- ‚úÖ Reader view with progress tracking
- ‚úÖ Offline caching with IndexedDB (Dexie.js)
- ‚úÖ Image caching for offline reading
- ‚úÖ Highlights and notes
- ‚úÖ Reading progress restoration
- ‚úÖ Three-tab filtering: Queue/Unread/Archived
- ‚úÖ Error boundaries prevent crashes
- ‚úÖ Defensive error handling throughout
- ‚úÖ Dark mode support
- ‚úÖ Typography controls (font size)

**Architecture:**
- **Extraction**: Jina AI Reader API (markdown output)
- **Conversion**: `marked` library for markdown ‚Üí HTML
- **Sanitization**: DOMPurify client-side
- **Storage**: Supabase (articles, highlights) + IndexedDB (offline)
- **Components**: ReaderPage, ArticleCard, SaveArticleDialog
- **Error Handling**: ErrorBoundary + try-catch throughout

**Quality Bar:**
This is the standard for Polymath features - polished, thoughtful UX with proper error handling.

## üéØ Next Task: Project Detail View

### Current State

**What exists:**
- Projects page with grid/list view
- Create/Edit/Delete projects
- Filtering by status
- Project cards show: title, description, type, status
- Rich metadata: tags, energy level, materials, next step, progress

**What's missing:**
- ‚ùå **Projects are not clickable** - no way to dive deeper
- ‚ùå **No detail view** - can't see full context
- ‚ùå **No activity stream** - can't see project history
- ‚ùå **No notes UI** - `project_notes` table exists but unused
- ‚ùå **No timeline view** - can't see how projects evolved

### Your Task

**Research + Implement a streamlined project detail view**

The user wants to make projects clickable, but **doesn't want ClickUp complexity**.
Goal: Keep it streamlined but powerful, like Linear.

---

## üìã Start Here: Deep Research Prompt

```
Do deep research on best-in-class project tracking software UX, focusing on:

1. **Tools to Analyze:**
   - Linear (minimal, fast, beautiful)
   - Notion (flexible detail pages)
   - Height (autonomous, smart)
   - Things 3 (elegant simplicity)
   - Asana (task-focused)
   - ClickUp (feature-rich - what to AVOID)

2. **Research Questions:**
   - What makes project detail views feel good to use?
   - How do they organize information hierarchy?
   - Where do they place quick actions?
   - How do they handle activity streams/updates?
   - What note-taking patterns work best?
   - How do they visualize progress?
   - How do they highlight "next steps"?

3. **Focus Areas:**
   - Information architecture
   - Mobile-first design patterns
   - Quick update patterns (low friction)
   - Timeline/activity stream design
   - Status transition UX
   - Note-taking within projects

4. **What to Avoid:**
   - Feature bloat (ClickUp problem)
   - Cognitive overload
   - Too many nested views
   - Complex workflows
   - Heavy configuration

5. **Design Philosophy for Polymath:**
   - **Streamlined** - Not trying to be ClickUp
   - **Focused** - Surface right info at right time
   - **Fast** - Linear-like speed and elegance
   - **Effortless** - Make updates feel easy
   - **Mobile-first** - Touch-optimized

After research, propose a design for Polymath's project detail view that:
- Matches the quality of our reading feature
- Follows mobile-first principles
- Makes updating projects feel effortless
- Maintains clean, focused aesthetic
```

## üìä What to Build (After Research)

### Route
`/projects/:id` - Full detail page (like `/reading/:id`)

### Core Information to Display
1. **Header**
   - Title, description
   - Type badge (personal/technical/meta)
   - Status (active/on-hold/maintaining/completed)
   - Quick actions (edit, status change, delete)

2. **Timeline**
   - Created date
   - Last active
   - Days since last update (if dormant)

3. **Context & Requirements**
   - Next step (prominent!)
   - Progress bar (if tracked)
   - Estimated time
   - Energy level required
   - Materials needed
   - Context requirements (desk, tools, etc.)
   - Tags

4. **Activity Stream** (if applicable)
   - Project notes chronologically
   - Status changes
   - Updates with timestamps

5. **Related Data** (if applicable)
   - Capabilities used
   - From suggestion ID (if built from AI suggestion)

### Key Features
- Click project card ‚Üí navigate to detail
- Quick update dialog (add note without friction)
