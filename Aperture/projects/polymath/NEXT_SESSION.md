### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues / TODOs

**1. Array Comparison Issue (Non-blocking)**
- PostgreSQL UUID[] array comparison not working with Supabase-js `.eq()`
- **Temporary Fix**: Disabled `recordCombination()` and simplified `calculateNovelty()` to return random scores
- **Impact**: Novelty scoring doesn't track repeat combinations yet
- **Future Fix**: Create PostgreSQL function for array comparison or use raw SQL

**2. TypeScript Strict Mode Disabled**
- Set to `strict: false` to get deployment working quickly
- **Future**: Re-enable and fix type issues properly

**3. No Interests from MemoryOS Yet**
- Synthesis found "0 interests (3+ mentions)"
- Need to add voice notes to MemoryOS to populate entities
- **Impact**: Interest scoring currently returns neutral 0.5

## üéâ Session 22 Fixes

### ‚úÖ Voice Processing Pipeline Restored

**Problem Found**: User flow analysis revealed voice notes were stored but never processed
- `api/capture.ts` imported deleted `../src/lib/process` (security cleanup)
- `api/process.ts` imported deleted `../src/lib/process`
- No entity extraction = no interests = no personalization

**Fixes Applied**:
1. ‚úÖ Created `api/lib/process-memory.ts` - Gemini-based entity extraction
2. ‚úÖ Fixed `api/capture.ts` import (line 59)
3. ‚úÖ Fixed `api/process.ts` import (line 2)
4. ‚úÖ Added base `memories` and `entities` tables to migration.sql
5. ‚úÖ Corrected all vector dimensions (1536‚Üí768 for Gemini text-embedding-004)

**Result**: Complete voice note ‚Üí entity extraction ‚Üí synthesis flow working ‚úÖ

See: `PROCESSING_PIPELINE_FIXED.md` for full details

## üéâ Previous Work (Session 21)

### ‚úÖ Complete Documentation Suite

**Vision & Design:**
- `CONCEPT.md` - Evolved vision (MemoryOS + Polymath unified system)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete technical design with algorithms
- `RATING_UX.md` - Interaction design and UX flows
- `ROADMAP.md` - 10-phase implementation plan
- `UI_COMPONENTS.md` - React component structure

**Implementation Ready:**
- `migration.sql` - Database schema (6 new tables + extensions)
- `API_SPEC.md` - Complete API documentation
- `DEPENDENCIES.md` - NPM packages and environment variables
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Step-by-step deployment checklist

**Scripts (Ready to Run):**
- `scripts/capability-scanner.ts` - Scans Aperture codebase
- `scripts/synthesis.ts` - Weekly AI synthesis engine
- `scripts/strengthen-nodes.ts` - Git activity tracking

---

## üß† Quick Context Refresh

**Polymath evolved from:**
- Original: Personal creative project tracker (painting, music, etc.)
- **NOW**: Meta-creative synthesis engine that:
  - Scans Aperture codebase for technical capabilities
  - Extracts interests from MemoryOS memories
  - Generates novel project suggestions (capability + interest Venn overlaps)
  - Strengthens nodes based on activity (reinforcement learning)
  - Anti-echo-chamber diversity injection (wild cards)

**Key Decision:** Same app as MemoryOS (deeply integrated, not separate)

---

## ‚ú® What Polymath Does

### Two Modes

**Mode 1: Personal Projects**
- Track creative pursuits (painting, writing, music)
- Manual tracking with last_active timestamps

**Mode 2: Meta-Creative Synthesis** (The Big Innovation)
- Weekly AI generates 10 project suggestions
- Combines your capabilities √ó your interests
- Example: "Voice-annotated photo timeline" (MemoryOS voice + Wizard photos)
- Point allocation: Novelty (30%) + Feasibility (40%) + Interest (30%)
- Every 4th suggestion = wild card (prevents creative narrowing)

### The Feedback Loop

```
Work on project ‚Üí Capability node strengthens ‚Üí More suggestions involving that capability
Rate suggestion üëç ‚Üí Boost similar ideas | Rate üëé ‚Üí Prune (but keep in permanent list)
Build suggestion üí° ‚Üí Create project + strengthen nodes significantly
```

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (When You're Ready)

### Phase 1: Database Migration (30 min)

**You need to:**
1. Open Supabase SQL editor
2. Copy/paste `migration.sql`
3. Run it
4. Verify 6 new tables created

**Then you'll have:**
- `projects` - Personal & technical projects
- `capabilities` - Technical capabilities from codebase
- `project_suggestions` - AI-generated ideas
- `suggestion_ratings` - Your feedback
- `node_strengths` - Activity-based strengths
- `capability_combinations` - For novelty scoring

---

### Phase 2: Populate Capabilities (1 hour)

**You need to:**
1. Add NPM dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd projects/memory-os
   npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk openai react-router-dom
   npm install --save-dev @types/node tsx
   ```

2. Add environment variables to Vercel:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   USER_ID=<your-supabase-user-id>
   ```

3. Run capability scanner:
   ```bash
   npx tsx ../polymath/scripts/capability-scanner.ts
   ```

**Then you'll have:**
- 20+ capabilities extracted (voice-processing, embeddings, face-alignment, etc.)
- Each with description, strength, source project
- Embeddings for semantic search

---

### Phase 3: Manual Synthesis MVP (Weekend)

**Build these API endpoints:**
- `api/projects.ts` - Projects CRUD
- `api/suggestions.ts` - List suggestions
- `api/suggestions/[id]/rate.ts` - Rating
- `api/synthesis/run.ts` - Manual synthesis

**Build these UI components:**
- `SuggestionCard.tsx` - Card with rating actions
- `SuggestionsPage.tsx` - Weekly digest view
- `ProjectsPage.tsx` - Projects list

**Then you can:**
- Manually trigger synthesis
- Get 10 novel project ideas
- Rate them (üëç üëé üí°)
- Build interesting ones
- See permanent ideas list

---

## üìã Quick Decision Guide

**"Should I start building now?"**
- ‚úÖ Yes, if you're excited and have 2-4 hours
- ‚ùå No, if you want to sleep first (docs are all ready)

**"What's the fastest path to usable Polymath?"**
‚Üí Weekend sprint (15h total):
  - Phase 1: Database (3h)
  - Phase 2: Capabilities (4h)
  - Phase 3: Manual synthesis MVP (8h)
  - Result: Working Polymath you can use!

**"What if I just want to test the concept?"**
‚Üí Just do Phase 1 + 2, then manually run synthesis script:
  ```bash
  npx tsx scripts/polymath/synthesis.ts
  ```
  Check Supabase to see suggestions generated

---

## üéØ Key Files to Read When You Start

**Before database work:**
1. `migration.sql` - Understand schema
2. `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Follow checklist

**Before building UI:**
1. `UI_COMPONENTS.md` - Component structure
2. `API_SPEC.md` - Endpoint contracts

**Before synthesis:**
1. `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Algorithms explained
2. `scripts/synthesis.ts` - Implementation

---

## üî• What Makes This Special

**Not just another project tracker:**
- Generates ideas you wouldn't think of yourself
- Strengthens based on what you actually do (git commits)
- Prevents creative echo chambers (wild cards)
- Permanent ideas list (even dismissed ones stay for diversity)
- Feeds off MemoryOS (your interests fuel suggestions)

**The "Holy Shit" moment:**
- AI suggests combining two capabilities you never thought to combine
- The combination aligns perfectly with recent MemoryOS thoughts
- You build it and it becomes your favorite project

---

## ‚ùì Open Questions (For You to Decide)

### Architecture (Answered ‚úÖ)
- **Decision:** Same app as MemoryOS, deeply integrated

### First-Time UX (You decide)
- Empty state? Import interests? Onboarding flow?

### Suggestion Frequency (You decide)
- Weekly synthesis? Manual only? Daily?

### Wild Card Strategy (You decide)
- Every 4th? Every 5th? Weekly "weird idea" day?
