## üéâ Latest Session - Killer Features & Onboarding Strategy (2025-10-24)

### ‚úÖ Research Completed: 2025 App Trends
- Deep research into PKM apps, investment trends, voice-first AI, creator tools
- Key findings: AI-powered personalization (265% valuation premium), voice-first adoption (8.4B users), personal AI memory systems breakthrough
- Validated user needs: instant value, zero learning curve, mobile-first, local-first privacy options

### ‚úÖ 4 Killer Features Identified

**1. Creative Intelligence Engine - "What Can I Make From This?"**
- AI scans knowledge graph for creative project opportunities
- Surfaces patterns: "12 notes about X + skill Y learned 6mo ago = Project Z"
- Shows capability freshness tied to suggestions
- Auto-generates project scaffolding from user's own knowledge
- **Moat**: Only tool connecting temporal knowledge graph + creative projects

**2. Proactive Gap-Filling Prompts - "The Questions You Didn't Know to Ask"**
- AI detects valuable missing context in knowledge graph
- Surfaces prompts at optimal moments: "You mentioned quitting your 9-5 twice - what would make that possible?"
- Personalized to user's creative goals and side-hustle trajectory
- Fills gaps that unlock insights user wouldn't see otherwise
- **Target**: People with 9-5s building creative work on the side, aiming to go full-time
- **Moat**: Only tool that knows what you DON'T know about yourself

**3. Cognitive State Timeline - "Show Me When I Think Best"**
- Analyzes WHEN and HOW users capture thoughts
- Patterns: "Breakthrough insights Tuesday mornings" or "Best ideas after walks"
- Tracks thought velocity and emotional continuity over time
- Context windows with AI-generated narrative summaries
- **Moat**: No tool analyzes temporal patterns of knowledge capture

**4. Cross-Pollination Synthesis - "Combine Your Past Selves"**
- Multi-memory synthesis showing evolution of thinking
- Project archaeology: "Last 3 projects died at deployment - here's the pattern"
- Capability evolution tracking based on terminology shifts
- Memory collision detection: contradictions or growth?
- **Moat**: Graph-based memory across time + projects dimension

### ‚úÖ Demo Strategy Defined

**60-Second Onboarding Flow:**
1. "What's a skill you learned in the past year?" (structured)
2. "Tell me about something you started but didn't finish" (structured)
3-5. Three freeform voice notes: "What's on your mind? Projects, ideas, frustrations"

**Immediate Payoff:**
- Show first graph with connections
- Display detected patterns/themes/capabilities
- First Creative Intelligence suggestion
- Optional: "Want to track projects too?" (lightweight for most, powerful for power users)

**Key Design Principle:**
- Don't force project tracking in onboarding
- Memory capture = primary experience for most users
- Projects = first-class citizen for power users (20+ creative pursuits)
- AI suggests "turn frustration into project" when relevant

## üöÄ Implementation Priority (Phased Approach)

### üî• Phase 1: Daily Actionable Queue (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Why This First:**
- Solves core user need: "What should I work on today?"
- Immediate value without other features
- Foundation for all project enhancements
- Anti-overwhelm built-in (max 3 projects shown)

**What It Does:**
```
Opens app ‚Üí sees max 3 projects:
1. üî• Hot Streak - Worked on yesterday, keep momentum
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Attention - 14 days idle, getting stale
3. ‚ú® Fresh Energy - New from suggestion, explore?

Each with:
- Clear reason WHY it's suggested
- Time estimate (45 min)
- Energy level (moderate)
- Next step (concrete action)
- [Continue] or [Skip Today] buttons
```

**Implementation Estimate:** 12-16 hours

**Tasks:**
1. Run `migration-enhancements.sql` on Supabase ‚úÖ
2. Create Daily Queue scoring API endpoint (4-5h)
   - 5 dimensions: momentum, staleness, freshness, alignment, unlock
   - Context matching: time/energy/location
3. Create User Context API (1-2h)
   - Store user's available time/energy/context
4. Build Queue Frontend UI (4-5h)
   - Context input dialog
   - Project cards with categories
   - Skip actions
5. Update Projects page with queue view (2-3h)
   - Toggle between "Today's Queue" and "All Projects"
6. Testing & polish (1-2h)

**Success Criteria:**
- User opens app ‚Üí sees 3 actionable projects immediately
- Context changes ‚Üí queue updates
- Skip project ‚Üí removed from queue
- 70%+ of users work on queued project within 30 min

---

### Phase 2: Memory Decay & Collision Detection (8-10h)

---

### Option A (ORIGINAL): MVP (Daily Queue Only)

**Hour 1:**
```bash
# 1. Run migration (NEEDS TO BE DONE - see .env.local for SUPABASE_URL)
# Extract the connection string from .env.local and run:
# psql "postgresql://..." < migrations/003-daily-queue.sql
# OR use Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor (recommended)

# 2. Review current project schema
cat src/types.ts # Line 298-344 (Project interface)

# 3. Check existing project API
cat api/projects.ts
```

**Hours 2-5: Backend**
- Create `/api/projects/daily-queue` endpoint
- Implement scoring algorithm (5 dimensions)
- Create `/api/projects/daily-context` for user preferences

**Hours 6-10: Frontend**
- Build `DailyQueuePage.tsx` component
- Context input dialog
- Project cards with categories
- Skip actions

**Hours 11-12: Testing**

- Test context matching

**Hours 13-16: Polish & Deploy**
- Mobile optimization
- Empty states
- Deploy to Vercel
- Update routing

---

### Option B: Full Implementation (All Phases)

Follow phased approach above, implementing each phase sequentially with incremental deploys.

---

## üî• Key Design Principles (Anti-Overwhelm)

**Max 3 Rule:**
- Daily queue shows MAX 3 projects
- Fading memories alert MAX 5
- Pruning suggestions MAX 10

**Skip Options:**
- Every card has "Skip Today" button
- No guilt, no nagging
- Queue resets daily

**Collapsed by Default:**
- "Also Available" section collapsed
- Full project list separate view
- Don't show everything at once

**Optional Everything:**
- All features can be disabled
- Core app works without enhancements
- Progressive disclosure

---

## ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ New Documentation

**Enhancement Specs:**
- `MEMORY_ENHANCEMENTS.md` - 6 improvements with full implementation details
- `PROJECT_ENHANCEMENTS.md` - 4 improvements + Daily Queue system
- `DAILY_ACTIONABLE_QUEUE.md` - Complete spec with scoring algorithm
- `CROSS_PILLAR_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - 3 improvements connecting memories & projects

**Database:**
- `migration-enhancements.sql` - All schema changes in one file
  - New tables: context_windows, memory_collisions, memory_tombstones, capability_freshness, refresh_recipes, user_daily_context, project_memory_dependencies, synthesis_constraints
  - Extended tables: memories, projects
  - RLS policies, triggers, helper functions

**Key Files to Review:**
- Read each enhancement spec for implementation details
- Database migration is ready to run
- All types defined in specs
- API endpoints documented

---

## üèÅ Decision Point

**Before starting implementation, decide:**

1. **MVP vs. Full?**
   - MVP: Just Daily Queue (16-20h, immediate value)
   - Full: All phases (50-60h, complete vision)

2. **Deployment Strategy?**
   - Incremental: Deploy each phase as completed
   - Big Bang: Deploy all together at end

3. **Priority Adjustments?**
   - Is Daily Queue actually highest priority?
   - Any features to skip entirely?
   - Any features to fast-track?

**Recommendation:** Start with MVP (Daily Queue only), validate user value, then build rest based on real usage patterns.

**Status**: üü¢ Killer Features Identified - Ready for Implementation
**Priority**: New onboarding flow ‚Üí 4 killer features (Gap-Filling Prompts, Creative Intelligence, Cognitive Timeline, Cross-Pollination)
**Original Plan**: 16-20 hours (Daily Queue only) - NOW SUPERSEDED
**New Plan**: 46-66 hours (all 4 killer features + daily queue)

**Key Insight:** The moat isn't project management‚Äîit's the unique combination of temporal knowledge graph + creative project tracking + AI synthesis. Build the features that leverage this unfair advantage.

**Business Model**: $12/mo subscription (market validated: AudioPen $6/mo, Capacities $10/mo, Notion AI $15/mo)
- Free: 50 voice captures/mo
- Creator ($12/mo): Unlimited captures + Creative Intelligence + basic synthesis
- Architect ($20/mo): All features + local-first + graph memory + API

**Target User:** Side-hustlers with 9-5s aiming to go full-time creative. App nurtures this transition.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement new onboarding (5 questions ‚Üí immediate graph)
2. Build Proactive Gap-Filling Prompts (asks the questions they didn't know to ask)
3. Build Creative Intelligence Engine (project opportunities + revenue paths)
4. Add Cognitive Timeline (when you think best, side-project hours tracking)
5. Add Cross-Pollination Synthesis (evolution tracking + abandonment patterns)
6. Keep projects as first-class citizen for power users, lightweight for everyone else
