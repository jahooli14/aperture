---

## üöÄ Implementation Priority (Phased Approach)

### üî• Phase 1: Daily Actionable Queue (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Why This First:**
- Solves core user need: "What should I work on today?"
- Immediate value without other features
- Foundation for all project enhancements
- Anti-overwhelm built-in (max 3 projects shown)

**What It Does:**
```
Opens app ‚Üí sees max 3 projects:
1. üî• Hot Streak - Worked on yesterday, keep momentum
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Attention - 14 days idle, getting stale
3. ‚ú® Fresh Energy - New from suggestion, explore?

Each with:
- Clear reason WHY it's suggested
- Time estimate (45 min)
- Energy level (moderate)
- Next step (concrete action)
- [Continue] or [Skip Today] buttons
```

**Implementation Estimate:** 12-16 hours

**Tasks:**
1. Run `migration-enhancements.sql` on Supabase ‚úÖ
2. Create Daily Queue scoring API endpoint (4-5h)
   - 5 dimensions: momentum, staleness, freshness, alignment, unlock
   - Context matching: time/energy/location
3. Create User Context API (1-2h)
   - Store user's available time/energy/context
4. Build Queue Frontend UI (4-5h)
   - Context input dialog
   - Project cards with categories
   - Skip actions
5. Update Projects page with queue view (2-3h)
   - Toggle between "Today's Queue" and "All Projects"
6. Testing & polish (1-2h)

**Success Criteria:**
- User opens app ‚Üí sees 3 actionable projects immediately
- Context changes ‚Üí queue updates
- Skip project ‚Üí removed from queue
- 70%+ of users work on queued project within 30 min

---

### Phase 2: Memory Decay & Collision Detection (8-10h)

**Why Second:**
- Prevents memory loss before it happens
- Novel feature (no PKM tool has collision detection)
- Uses existing memory data

**Features:**
1. **Memory Decay Visualization**
   - Strength score on each memory card
   - Alert for top 5 fading memories
   - Review button updates strength

2. **Memory Collision Detection**
   - AI detects contradictions when new memory created
   - "Your view on React changed: March vs June"
   - Resolution tracking (evolved, error, context-dependent)

**Implementation:**
- Backend: Decay calculation function, collision detection API
- Frontend: Strength indicators, collision alert modal

---

### Phase 3: Project Graveyard & Capability Freshness (10-12h)

**Why Third:**
- Embraces reality of abandoned projects
- Freshness alerts prevent skill decay
- Refresh recipes provide concrete actions

**Features:**
1. **Project Graveyard**
   - Mandatory post-mortem when abandoning
   - Pattern analysis: "You abandon at deployment 70% of time"
   - Graveyard view with insights

2. **Capability Freshness Alerts**
   - Track last usage per capability
   - Alert when rusty (45+ days)
   - AI generates refresh recipe (2-hour micro-project)

**Implementation:**
- Backend: Abandonment flow, freshness tracking, recipe generation
- Frontend: Post-mortem modal, freshness dashboard, recipe cards

---

### Phase 4: Cross-Pillar Features (6-8h)

**Why Fourth:**
- Closes feedback loops between memories & projects
- Requires other features as foundation

**Features:**
1. **Memory ‚Üí Project Dependencies**
   - Link required memories to projects
   - "Review Design System memory before continuing"

2. **Project Completion ‚Üí Auto-Memory**
   - Reflection prompt on completion
   - Creates memory with learnings

3. **Synthesis Constraints**
   - "Only projects under 1 week"
   - "Use stale capabilities"
   - Quick presets

---

### Phase 5: Context Windows & Synthesis Notes (8-10h)

**Why Last:**
- Nice-to-have vs. must-have
- More complex AI work
- Lower immediate impact

**Features:**
1. **Context Windows**
   - Auto-cluster memories by week/month
   - AI-generated theme summaries
   - Timeline view

2. **Cross-Memory Synthesis Notes**
   - Link 2-3 memories into new memory
   - Meta-insights from combinations

---

## üìä Implementation Timeline

### Realistic Scope (50-60 hours total)

**Week 1-2: Daily Queue (Core Value)**
- Phase 1: Daily Actionable Queue (12-16h)
- Deploy to production
- Gather user feedback

**Week 3-4: Memory Intelligence**

---

## üéØ Next Session: Start Here

### Option A: MVP (Daily Queue Only)

**Hour 1:**
```bash
# 1. Run migration
psql $SUPABASE_URL < migration-enhancements.sql

# 2. Review current project schema
cat src/types.ts # Line 298-344 (Project interface)

# 3. Check existing project API
cat api/projects.ts
```

**Hours 2-5: Backend**
- Create `/api/projects/daily-queue` endpoint
- Implement scoring algorithm (5 dimensions)
- Create `/api/projects/daily-context` for user preferences

**Hours 6-10: Frontend**
- Build `DailyQueuePage.tsx` component
- Context input dialog
- Project cards with categories
- Skip actions

**Hours 11-12: Testing**
- Seed test data
- Verify scoring
- Test context matching

**Hours 13-16: Polish & Deploy**
- Mobile optimization
- Empty states
- Deploy to Vercel
- Update routing

---

### Option B: Full Implementation (All Phases)

Follow phased approach above, implementing each phase sequentially with incremental deploys.

---

## üî• Key Design Principles (Anti-Overwhelm)

**Max 3 Rule:**
- Daily queue shows MAX 3 projects
- Fading memories alert MAX 5
- Pruning suggestions MAX 10

**Skip Options:**
- Every card has "Skip Today" button
- No guilt, no nagging
- Queue resets daily

**Collapsed by Default:**
- "Also Available" section collapsed
- Full project list separate view
- Don't show everything at once

**Optional Everything:**
- All features can be disabled
- Core app works without enhancements
- Progressive disclosure

---

## ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ New Documentation

**Enhancement Specs:**
- `MEMORY_ENHANCEMENTS.md` - 6 improvements with full implementation details
- `PROJECT_ENHANCEMENTS.md` - 4 improvements + Daily Queue system
- `DAILY_ACTIONABLE_QUEUE.md` - Complete spec with scoring algorithm
- `CROSS_PILLAR_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - 3 improvements connecting memories & projects

**Database:**
- `migration-enhancements.sql` - All schema changes in one file
  - New tables: context_windows, memory_collisions, memory_tombstones, capability_freshness, refresh_recipes, user_daily_context, project_memory_dependencies, synthesis_constraints
  - Extended tables: memories, projects
  - RLS policies, triggers, helper functions

**Key Files to Review:**
- Read each enhancement spec for implementation details
- Database migration is ready to run
- All types defined in specs
- API endpoints documented

---

## üèÅ Decision Point

**Before starting implementation, decide:**

1. **MVP vs. Full?**
   - MVP: Just Daily Queue (16-20h, immediate value)
   - Full: All phases (50-60h, complete vision)

2. **Deployment Strategy?**
   - Incremental: Deploy each phase as completed
   - Big Bang: Deploy all together at end

3. **Priority Adjustments?**
   - Is Daily Queue actually highest priority?
   - Any features to skip entirely?
   - Any features to fast-track?

**Recommendation:** Start with MVP (Daily Queue only), validate user value, then build rest based on real usage patterns.

**Status**: üü° Design Complete - Ready for Implementation
**Priority**: Daily Actionable Queue (solves "what to work on today?")
**Estimated MVP**: 16-20 hours (Daily Queue only)
**Estimated Full**: 50-60 hours (all enhancements)

**Key Insight:** Daily Queue is the killer feature. Everything else supports it but isn't required for initial value. Start there, validate, then expand. üöÄ
