# Next Session - Polymath

**Last updated**: 2025-10-26
**Branch**: main
**Status**: ✅ Critical bugs fixed!

---

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Voice Capture - FIXED ✅
**Issue**: Voice capture stop button not saving transcripts on Android/native
**Solution**:
- Created `/api/transcribe` endpoint using Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Updated `useCapacitorVoice.ts` to call transcription API
- Works on both web (Web Speech API) and native (Capacitor + Gemini)

**Files changed**:
- `api/transcribe.ts` (new)
- `src/hooks/useCapacitorVoice.ts`

---

### 2. Project Creation - FIXED ✅
**Issue**: Project creation failing even after previous fixes
**Root cause**: Frontend was using direct Supabase client which couldn't set `user_id`
**Solution**:
- Updated `/api/projects` POST endpoint to add `user_id` server-side
- Changed frontend to use API endpoint instead of direct Supabase
- Server-side approach bypasses RLS and is more secure

**Files changed**:
- `api/projects.ts`
- `src/stores/useProjectStore.ts`

---

## 🚀 Ready for Testing

Both fixes are deployed via GitHub push (Vercel auto-deploys).

**Test checklist**:
- [ ] Voice capture on Android saves and processes correctly
- [ ] Project creation works on web
- [ ] Project creation works on Android
