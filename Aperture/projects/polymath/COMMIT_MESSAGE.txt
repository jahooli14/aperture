feat(memory-os): integrate Polymath meta-creative synthesis engine

BREAKING: This is a major integration that merges the Polymath project
into MemoryOS, creating a unified creative intelligence system.

## What Changed

### New Features
- **Polymath Integration**: Meta-creative synthesis engine now part of MemoryOS
  - AI generates project ideas by combining codebase capabilities √ó user interests
  - Weekly synthesis (Vercel cron: Monday 09:00 UTC)
  - Daily node strengthening based on git activity
  - Point allocation: novelty (30%) + feasibility (40%) + interest (30%)
  - Diversity injection: every 4th suggestion is a "wild card"
  - Permanent ideas list with rating system (üëç Spark / üëé Meh / üí° Build)
  - Bidirectional integration with MemoryOS knowledge graph

### Files Added (16 total)

#### Scripts (scripts/polymath/)
- capability-scanner.ts - Scans Aperture codebase for technical capabilities
- synthesis.ts - AI synthesis engine (Claude Sonnet 4.5 + OpenAI embeddings)
- strengthen-nodes.ts - Git activity tracker and node strength updater
- seed-test-data.ts - Test data generator (no AI needed)
- migration.sql - Database schema (6 new tables)

#### API Endpoints (api/)
- projects.ts - Projects CRUD
- projects/[id].ts - Single project operations
- suggestions.ts - GET all suggestions with filtering
- suggestions/[id]/rate.ts - Rating with learning feedback
- suggestions/[id]/build.ts - Build project from suggestion
- cron/weekly-synthesis.ts - Monday synthesis job
- cron/strengthen-nodes.ts - Daily node strengthening job

#### React Components (src/components/)
- suggestions/SuggestionCard.tsx - Suggestion display with scores
- suggestions/RatingActions.tsx - Quick rating buttons
- suggestions/WildcardBadge.tsx - Diversity indicator
- projects/ProjectCard.tsx - Project display card
- capabilities/CapabilityBadge.tsx - Capability badge component

### Files Updated (5 total)
- package.json - Added @anthropic-ai/sdk, openai, react-router-dom, tsx
- vercel.json - Added cron jobs (weekly synthesis + daily strengthening)
- src/types.ts - Added 400+ lines of Polymath types
- README.md - Documented Polymath integration
- NEXT_SESSION.md - Consolidated MemoryOS + Polymath status

### Documentation (4 guides)
- WAKE_UP_SUMMARY.md - Quick overview for next session
- INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md - Complete integration summary
- TESTING_GUIDE.md - Step-by-step testing instructions
- Reference docs in ../polymath/ (13 files: CONCEPT, ARCHITECTURE, etc.)

## Database Changes
Requires migration: scripts/migration.sql creates 6 new tables:
- projects - Personal/technical/meta projects
- capabilities - Technical capabilities from codebase
- project_suggestions - AI-generated project ideas
- suggestion_ratings - User ratings and feedback
- node_strengths - Activity-based capability strengths
- capability_combinations - Novel capability pairings

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **MemoryOS ‚Üí Polymath**: Interests extracted from memories feed synthesis
- **Polymath ‚Üí MemoryOS**: Active projects become entities in knowledge graph
- **Activity Loop**: Git commits ‚Üí strengthen nodes ‚Üí influence future suggestions
- **Diversity**: Anti-echo-chamber wild cards prevent filter bubble

### AI Stack
- Claude Sonnet 4.5: Project idea generation and synthesis
- OpenAI: Embeddings for semantic similarity
- Gemini 2.5 Flash: Entity extraction (existing MemoryOS)

### Automation
- Monday 09:00 UTC: Weekly synthesis generates 10 new suggestions
- Daily 00:00 UTC: Node strengthening based on git activity

## Testing
No tests added yet (UI pending). Testing guide provided:
- Seed test data: `npx tsx scripts/polymath/seed-test-data.ts`
- Verify Supabase: 8 capabilities, 4 suggestions

## Next Steps (Not in this commit)
- [ ] Create UI pages (ProjectsPage, SuggestionsPage, AllIdeasPage)
- [ ] Add routing (react-router-dom)
- [ ] Create Zustand stores (useProjectStore, useSuggestionStore)
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel with environment variables

## Deployment Checklist
Required environment variables:
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- OPENAI_API_KEY (embeddings)
- USER_ID (Supabase user ID)
- CRON_SECRET (optional, for cron job security)

## Integration Stats
- 16 implementation files added
- 5 configuration files updated
- 4,000+ lines of code
- 15,000+ words of documentation
- 100% unified (no separate repos/deployments)

## Breaking Changes
None. This is purely additive to MemoryOS. Existing functionality unchanged.
