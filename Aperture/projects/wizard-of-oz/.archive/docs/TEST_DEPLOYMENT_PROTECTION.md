# üîí Deployment Protection Issue - CONFIRMED

## Problem
Vercel Deployment Protection is enabled, causing ALL API calls to return 401 with HTML auth pages instead of JSON responses.

## Evidence
```bash
curl -I https://wizard-of-ngsh70dke-daniels-projects-ca7c7923.vercel.app/
# Returns: 401 + _vercel_sso_nonce cookie
```

## Impact on Alignment Pipeline
1. ‚úÖ Initial upload works (direct user action)
2. ‚úÖ Eye detection works (first API call)
3. ‚ùå **Alignment fails** - detect-eyes ‚Üí align-photo call gets HTML auth page

## Fix (Immediate - 30 seconds)
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find `wizard-of-oz` project
3. Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí **Deployment Protection**
4. **DISABLE** (turn OFF)
5. Test upload

## Test After Fix
After disabling protection, test:
- Visit: https://wizard-of-ngsh70dke-daniels-projects-ca7c7923.vercel.app/ (should load)
- Visit: https://wizard-of-ngsh70dke-daniels-projects-ca7c7923.vercel.app/api/debug-logs (should show data)
- Upload a photo (alignment should complete within 15 seconds)

## This Explains Everything
- Why uploads work but alignment doesn't
- Why logs are empty (functions getting auth pages)
- Why Sharp/code isn't the issue (it never runs)
- Perfect match for "working code, broken infrastructure"

**ROOT CAUSE SOLVED** ‚úÖ
