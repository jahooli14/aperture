Analysis of Test Results:

Target positions:
- LEFT eye (baby's left, RIGHT side of image): x=720, y=432
- RIGHT eye (baby's right, LEFT side of image): x=360, y=432

Final verification detected:
- "leftEye": x=452, y=265
- "rightEye": x=672, y=245

IF Gemini's labels are backwards (which is common):
- Baby's ACTUAL left eye (right side): x=672, y=245
- Baby's ACTUAL right eye (left side): x=452, y=265

Error from targets (with swapped interpretation):
- Left eye error: (672-720, 245-432) = (-48, -187) px
- Right eye error: (452-360, 265-432) = (92, -167) px

Conclusion: Eyes are roughly 170-190px TOO HIGH (y-axis),
but X-axis is reasonable (~50-90px off, which is acceptable).

The Y-axis error suggests the scaling or extraction calculation has a bug.
