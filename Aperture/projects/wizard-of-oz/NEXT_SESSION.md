## üöÄ Next Features to Implement

### Priority 1: Timelapse Generator (~4-6 hours)

**What**: Automatically create video/GIF timelapses from aligned photos

- Process photos directly in browser
- Export MP4/WebM video
- Privacy-first, zero server cost
- Preview before download

**Option B: Server-Side**
- Vercel serverless function
- Use FFmpeg to stitch photos
- Return video URL or download

**Features to Consider**:
- [ ] Crossfade transitions (2-3 sec per photo)
- [ ] Duration control (total video length)
- [ ] Music/soundtrack overlay
- [ ] Export formats (MP4, WebM, GIF)
- [ ] Resolution options (1080p, 720p)

---

### Priority 2: Shareable Links (~4-6 hours)

**What**: Generate public comparison links (no auth required)

**Implementation**:
1. New `shares` database table
2. Generate unique tokens
