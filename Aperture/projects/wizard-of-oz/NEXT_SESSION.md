2. Get API key from dashboard
3. (Optional) Verify custom domain for professional emails

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Vercel
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
CRON_SECRET=<generate-random-string>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<from-supabase>
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-production-url.vercel.app
```

### Step 3: Run Database Migration
Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/003_add_email_reminders.sql
-- (Copy contents from file and execute)
```

### Step 4: Test
1. Go to Privacy & Security settings
2. Enter your email
3. Set reminder time to current time + 5 minutes
4. Enable reminders
5. Don't upload a photo
6. Check your email!

## üöÄ Next Features to Implement

### Priority 1: Email Reminders Setup
**Complete the setup steps above** to activate daily photo reminders!

### Priority 2: Native Mobile App (Discussed in Session 18)

**Why**: Email reminders are good, but native push notifications are better!

**Path Forward**:
- React Native with Expo
- Reuse business logic (~60% code share)
- Native camera & push notifications
- 2-3 weeks to MVP
- See session notes for full native app roadmap

**For now**: Email reminders provide good MVP validation

### Priority 3: Timelapse Generator (~4-6 hours)

**What**: Automatically create video/GIF timelapses from aligned photos

**Why Now**: Photos are already aligned perfectly! Faces center-aligned at consistent positions = smooth professional timelapse

**Implementation Options**:

**Option A: Client-Side (Recommended)**
- Use FFmpeg.wasm or MediaRecorder API
- Process photos directly in browser
- Export MP4/WebM video
- Privacy-first, zero server cost
- Preview before download

**Option B: Server-Side**
- Vercel serverless function
- Use FFmpeg to stitch photos
- Return video URL or download

**Features to Consider**:
- [ ] Crossfade transitions (2-3 sec per photo)
- [ ] Duration control (total video length)
- [ ] Music/soundtrack overlay
- [ ] Export formats (MP4, WebM, GIF)
- [ ] Resolution options (1080p, 720p)

---

### Priority 4: Shareable Links (~4-6 hours)

**What**: Generate public comparison links (no auth required)

**Implementation**:
1. New `shares` database table
2. Generate unique tokens
3. Public route `/share/[token]`
4. Expiration logic (7 days default)
5. Share button in ComparisonView

## üêõ Known Issues

None! Everything is working well.

## üí° Future Ideas (Backlog)

- **Streak Tracker**: Show consecutive days with photos, gamification
- **Growth Visualization**: Chart showing face changes over time
- **Custom Watermarks**: Add baby's name/age to photos
- **Multiple Babies**: Support for twins/siblings
- **Monthly Summaries**: Auto-generated "Month in Review"
- **Export Features**: PDF collages, formatted exports
- **PWA Push Notifications**: Before going fully native
- **SMS Reminders**: Twilio integration for higher engagement

## üîó Deployment

Current deployment: **Production URL TBD** (check Vercel dashboard)
