## 📝 Notes for Next Session

### Current State

This project was just extracted from Polymath on 2025-10-22. All core files have been copied and dependencies are configured, but the project hasn't been tested yet.

### Key Integration Points

**For Polymath Integration:**
```typescript
// In polymath/lib/process-memory.ts
import { detectMilestones } from '../../baby-milestone-tracker/lib/milestone-detector.js'
```

**For Standalone Use:**
- Need to create a simple UI for voice note capture
- Can reuse Audiopen webhook or build custom capture

### Environment Variables Needed

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
```

### Database Migration

The SQL file is ready at `scripts/add-milestone-tables.sql` but hasn't been run yet. Need to:
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy/paste the migration
3. Execute it
4. Verify tables created
