# MemoryOS - Next Session

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Ready to deploy (blocked by Vercel platform issues)

---

## ‚úÖ Completed

### Code & Infrastructure (100%)
- ‚úÖ Database schema created and running on Supabase
  - `memories` table with vector search
  - `bridges` table for connections
  - `match_memories()` function for semantic search
- ‚úÖ All code implemented:
  - `api/capture.ts` - Audiopen webhook endpoint
  - `api/process.ts` - Manual processing trigger
  - `src/lib/process.ts` - Processing pipeline
  - `src/lib/gemini.ts` - AI metadata extraction + embeddings
  - `src/lib/bridges.ts` - Bridge finding (entity, semantic, temporal)
  - Frontend with MemoryCard component
- ‚úÖ Build verified: `npm run build` passes locally
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured in Vercel:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `vercel.json` restored and committed

### Database Verification
Ran connection test - all tables and functions exist:
```
‚úÖ memories table exists
‚úÖ bridges table exists
‚úÖ match_memories function exists
```

## üî¥ Blocked

**Vercel Deployment**: Platform having "temporary_failure" errors
- Last 3 deploy attempts: all ERROR state
- Error: "An unexpected error happened when running this build"
- **Not a code issue** - build passes locally
- **Action**: Retry deployment when Vercel is stable

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to Production (5 min)
```bash
cd projects/memory-os
vercel --prod --yes
```

Verify deployment succeeds and get production URL.

### 2. Configure Audiopen Webhook (5 min)
1. Go to Audiopen ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Integrations
2. Enable "Automatic Webhook"
3. Set URL: `https://[your-app].vercel.app/api/capture`
4. Optional processing prompt:
   ```
   Structure this note with: title, key insights, entities mentioned
   (people, places, topics), and emotional tone.
   ```

### 3. Test End-to-End (10 min)
1. Record test voice note in Audiopen
2. Wait 4 minutes (Audiopen processing)
3. Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs --follow`
4. Check Supabase: `select * from memories;`
5. Visit app URL - should show memory with metadata
6. Record 2nd note - should show bridges between memories

## üìä System Architecture

**Flow**: Voice Note ‚Üí Audiopen ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Supabase ‚Üí AI Processing ‚Üí Bridges ‚Üí Frontend

**Processing Pipeline**:
1. Audiopen sends webhook to `/api/capture`
2. Raw memory stored in DB (unprocessed)
3. Background job extracts metadata with Gemini:
   - Memory type (foundational/event/insight)
   - Entities (people, places, topics)
   - Themes and emotional tone
   - Vector embedding (768D)
4. Bridge finder searches for connections:
   - Entity matches (shared people/topics)
   - Semantic similarity (>80% cosine)
   - Temporal proximity (within 7 days)
5. Frontend displays memories with connections

## üîß Useful Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
vercel ls memory-os

# View production logs
vercel logs --follow

# Test webhook locally
curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/capture \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "test-123",
    "title": "Test Note",
    "body": "This is a test memory about James and coffee.",
    "orig_transcript": "",
    "tags": "test",
    "date_created": "2025-10-20T12:00:00Z"
  }'

# Query Supabase (go to Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor):
select id, title, processed, memory_type from memories order by created_at desc;
select * from bridges order by strength desc;
```

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Google Maps Grounding (Week 3-4)
Add location awareness to memories:
- Capture location when recording
- Use Gemini Maps grounding for place details
- Add spatial bridges ("memories near here")
- Daily digest: "You're near 3 past insights"

**Implementation**: 2-3 days after core system working

## üìù Notes

- **Supabase**: `nxkysxgaujdimrubjiln.supabase.co`
- **Vercel Project**: `prj_ZXytxziRE7m3RQYqhFWFbEz0fvKQ`
- **Code Quality**: Production-ready, type-safe, proper error handling
- **Estimated Time to Live**: ~20 minutes once Vercel deploying works
