# MemoryOS - Next Session

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Ready to deploy (blocked by Vercel platform issues)

---

## ‚úÖ Completed

### Code & Infrastructure (100%)
- ‚úÖ Database schema created and running on Supabase
  - `memories` table with vector search
  - `bridges` table for connections
  - `match_memories()` function for semantic search
- ‚úÖ All code implemented:
  - `api/capture.ts` - Audiopen webhook endpoint
  - `api/process.ts` - Manual processing trigger
  - `src/lib/process.ts` - Processing pipeline
  - `src/lib/gemini.ts` - AI metadata extraction + embeddings
  - `src/lib/bridges.ts` - Bridge finding (entity, semantic, temporal)
  - Frontend with MemoryCard component
- ‚úÖ Build verified: `npm run build` passes locally
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured in Vercel:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `vercel.json` restored and committed

### Database Verification
Ran connection test - all tables and functions exist:
```
‚úÖ memories table exists
‚úÖ bridges table exists
‚úÖ match_memories function exists
```

## üî¥ Blocked

**Vercel Deployment**: Platform having "temporary_failure" errors
- Last 3 deploy attempts: all ERROR state
- Error: "An unexpected error happened when running this build"
- **Not a code issue** - build passes locally
- **Action**: Retry deployment when Vercel is stable

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to Production (5 min)
```bash
cd projects/memory-os
vercel --prod --yes
```

Verify deployment succeeds and get production URL.

### 2. Configure Audiopen Webhook (5 min)
1. Go to Audiopen ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Integrations
2. Enable "Automatic Webhook"
3. Set URL: `https://[your-app].vercel.app/api/capture`
4. Optional processing prompt:
   ```
   Structure this note with: title, key insights, entities mentioned
   (people, places, topics), and emotional tone.
   ```

### 3. Test End-to-End (10 min)
1. Record test voice note in Audiopen
2. Wait 4 minutes (Audiopen processing)
3. Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs --follow`
4. Check Supabase: `select * from memories;`
5. Visit app URL - should show memory with metadata
6. Record 2nd note - should show bridges between memories

## üìä System Architecture

**Flow**: Voice Note ‚Üí Audiopen ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Supabase ‚Üí AI Processing ‚Üí Bridges ‚Üí Frontend

**Processing Pipeline**:
1. Audiopen sends webhook to `/api/capture`
2. Raw memory stored in DB (unprocessed)
3. Background job extracts metadata with Gemini:
   - Memory type (foundational/event/insight)
   - Entities (people, places, topics)
   - Themes and emotional tone
   - Vector embedding (768D)
4. Bridge finder searches for connections:
   - Entity matches (shared people/topics)
   - Semantic similarity (>80% cosine)
   - Temporal proximity (within 7 days)
5. Frontend displays memories with connections

## üîß Useful Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
vercel ls memory-os

# View production logs
vercel logs --follow

# Test webhook locally
curl -X POST http://localhost:5173/api/capture \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "test-123",
    "title": "Test Note",
    "body": "This is a test memory about James and coffee.",
    "orig_transcript": "",
    "tags": "test",
    "date_created": "2025-10-20T12:00:00Z"
  }'

# Query Supabase (go to Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor):
select id, title, processed, memory_type from memories order by created_at desc;
select * from bridges order by strength desc;
```

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Google Maps Grounding Integration (Week 3-4)

**Source**: Google Maps grounding now available in Gemini API (GA October 2025)

**Why Perfect Match for MemoryOS**:
- Location is the strongest biological memory trigger
- Spatial context reinforces recall bidirectionally
- Pattern discovery: "I have creative insights at coffee shops, tactical insights at office"

**Features to Add**:
1. **Location-Tagged Memories**
   - Auto-capture location via browser geolocation when recording
   - Gemini Maps grounding resolves coordinates ‚Üí place details (name, hours, reviews)
   - Store in memory JSON: `{ place: "Bluestone Lane", address: "123 Main St", details: "outdoor seating" }`

2. **Spatial Bridges**
   - New bridge type: `location` (in addition to entity_match, semantic, temporal)
   - Query: "memories within X miles of current location"
   - Strength based on proximity + semantic relevance

3. **Location-Based Insights**
   - Daily digest: "You're near 3 past memories" (geo-triggered)
   - "Last time here, you thought about X"
   - Pattern discovery: "Your best insights happen at cafes with outdoor seating"

4. **Memory Walks** (Novel Use Case)
   - Open app at a location ‚Üí shows memories recorded there
   - Reinforces biological memory through spatial context
   - Discover connections: "You always think about X topic in Y type of place"

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
// Update gemini.ts to use combined grounding
const response = await model.generateContent({
  prompt: "Analyze this voice note...",
  grounding: {
    googleMaps: true,    // Real place data
    googleSearch: true   // Contextual info
  }
});

// Add location column to schema
ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN location JSONB;

// Add location bridge type
ALTER TABLE bridges DROP CONSTRAINT bridges_bridge_type_check;
ALTER TABLE bridges ADD CONSTRAINT bridges_bridge_type_check
  CHECK (bridge_type IN ('entity_match', 'semantic_similarity', 'temporal_proximity', 'location'));
```

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days after core system working
**ROI**: üî•üî•üî• Very high - location + memory is scientifically proven powerful combination
