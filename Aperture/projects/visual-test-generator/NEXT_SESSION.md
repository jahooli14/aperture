## 🎯 Tomorrow's Checklist (Day 1)

### Morning: Review & Validate (1-2 hours)

- [ ] Read through all documentation
- [ ] Review technical approach in `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [ ] Validate 6-week roadmap makes sense
- [ ] Check research documents for any gaps
- [ ] Confirm tools/models are still accessible

**Questions to answer:**
- Does the technical approach still feel right?
- Any concerns about feasibility?
- Are the success metrics appropriate?
- Should we adjust scope/timeline?

---

### Afternoon: Environment Setup (2-3 hours)

**1. Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd /Users/dancroome-horgan/Documents/GitHub/Aperture/projects/visual-test-generator
npm install
```

**2. Verify Browser Capabilities**
```bash
# Check WebGPU support
# Open Chrome/Edge and visit: chrome://gpu/
# Confirm "WebGPU: Hardware accelerated" appears

# Test basic Transformers.js
node
> const { pipeline } = require('@xenova/transformers');
> // If no errors, good to go
```

**3. Create Initial Source Files**
```bash
mkdir -p src/{core,models,utils,types,ui}
touch src/index.ts
touch src/types/index.ts
```

**4. Set up Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
# Should start Vite dev server
```

---

### Evening: Week 1 Day 1 Tasks (2-3 hours)

**Per `ROADMAP.md` Week 1 Day 1:**

- [ ] Initialize npm project (DONE above)
- [ ] Configure build system (DONE - Vite + TypeScript)
- [ ] Set up directory structure (DONE)
- [ ] Create basic project scaffolding
- [ ] Test that `npm run build` works

**Create Initial Files:**

`src/types/index.ts`:
```typescript
// Core type definitions
export interface VideoRecording {
  blob: Blob;
  duration: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}

export interface Frame {
  image: string; // Base64 data URL
  timestamp: number;
  hash: string;
}

export interface TestConfig {
  framework: 'playwright' | 'cypress' | 'vitest';
  outputPath: string;
}
```

`src/core/video-recorder.ts`:
```typescript
// Stub implementation for Week 1 Day 2-3
export class VideoRecorder {
  async startRecording(): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation needed: MediaRecorder API
    throw new Error('Not implemented yet');
  }

  async stopRecording(): Promise<Blob> {
    // Implementation needed
    throw new Error('Not implemented yet');
  }
}
```

## 📅 Week 1 Overview (Reference)

**Days 1-5 focus on video infrastructure:**

| Day | Focus | Deliverable |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| **Day 1** (Tomorrow) | Project setup | Build system working |
| **Day 2-3** | Video recording | Can record + save videos |
| **Day 4-5** | Frame extraction | Intelligent keyframe detection |

**Success criteria for Week 1:**
- Can record 2-minute workflow video in browser
- Extracts 10-15 meaningful frames automatically
- Frames saved and ready for AI processing

---

## 🎓 Learning Resources for Tomorrow

### Must Read Before Starting

1. **MediaRecorder API**
   - MDN Docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder
   - Focus on: `getDisplayMedia()`, recording options, blob handling

2. **WebGPU Basics**
   - Check if your machine supports it
   - Understand performance capabilities
   - GPU specs matter for model inference speed

3. **Transformers.js**
   - GitHub: https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js
   - Browse examples for vision models
   - Understand pipeline API

---

## ⚠️ Potential Blockers & Solutions

### Blocker 1: WebGPU Not Available
**Symptom:** `navigator.gpu` is undefined
**Solution:**
- Use Chrome 113+ or Edge 113+
- Enable experimental features if needed
- Fallback to WebGL if necessary

### Blocker 2: Model Download Fails
**Symptom:** Can't download Florence-2/SmolVLM
**Solution:**
- Check internet connection
- Use CDN fallback
- Download manually and serve locally

### Blocker 3: OPFS Not Working
**Symptom:** Can't save videos locally
**Solution:**
- Check browser support (Chrome 102+)
- Use IndexedDB as fallback
- Test with smaller files first

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics for Week 1

**Technical Milestones:**
- [ ] Video recording works in browser
- [ ] Can capture 1920x1080 @ 30fps
- [ ] Save/load videos from OPFS
- [ ] Extract frames with visual diff algorithm
- [ ] Preview extracted frames in UI

**Time Budget:**
- Total: ~40 hours
- Buffer: Built in to each day's plan
- If blocked: Ask for help, don't spin wheels

---

## 📋 Decision Points

### Tomorrow's Key Decisions

**Decision 1: Video Format**
- WebM (VP9) vs MP4 (H.264)
- **Recommendation:** WebM (better browser support, smaller files)

**Decision 2: Frame Extraction Strategy**
- Fixed interval (every N seconds) vs Intelligent (visual diff)
- **Recommendation:** Intelligent (fewer frames, better quality)

**Decision 3: UI Framework**
- Plain React vs UI library (shadcn/ui, MUI)
- **Recommendation:** Start plain, add library if needed

---

## 📞 Communication Plan

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start small** - Get video recording working before optimizing
2. **Test frequently** - Validate each component as you build
3. **Document decisions** - Note why you chose approach A vs B
4. **Ask for help** - If stuck >1 hour, seek assistance
5. **Celebrate wins** - Mark progress visibly
