## 📋 What You Need to Provide

### 1. Google Gemini API Key 🔑
**Get from**: [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
- Free tier available for development/testing
- Paid usage for production (very affordable)
- Set as `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable

### 2. Playwright Browsers (Optional) 🌐
**Install with**: `npx playwright install`
- Only needed if you want to run actual tests
- Framework works without browsers for dry-run mode

### 3. Test Files 📁
- Framework works with any existing Playwright tests
- Sample tests provided in `/examples/sample-tests/`
- Will heal common test failure patterns automatically

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Get API Key**:
   ```bash
   # Visit https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
   # Copy your API key
   ```

2. **Configure**:
   ```bash
   cd projects/self-healing-tests
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add: GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

3. **Install Browsers** (optional):
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

4. **Test Configuration**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   node dist/cli.js validate-config
   ```

5. **Run Example**:
   ```bash
   node dist/cli.js run ./examples/sample-tests/login.test.ts
   ```

## 💰 Cost Expectations

### Development/Testing (Computer Use Model)
- **Simple test fix**: ~$0.001 USD
- **Complex analysis**: ~$0.005 USD
- **With screenshot analysis**: +~$0.002-0.003 USD
- **Daily development**: <$0.50 USD

### Production Usage
- **Per healing attempt**: $0.001-$0.01 USD
- **100 tests/day**: ~$1-10 USD/month
- **Cost controls**: Built-in limits and monitoring
- **Visual analysis**: Optimized for browser automation tasks

## 🌟 Current Capabilities

### What It Can Heal ✅
- Changed selectors (`#old-id` → `#new-id`)
- Modified button text ("Submit" → "Send")
- Layout changes (element moved positions)
- Timing issues (slower loading)
- New form fields or steps
- Updated validation messages
- Different navigation flows

### What It Can't Heal Yet ⚠️
- Completely redesigned UIs (>80% change)
