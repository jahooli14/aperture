# Claude Startup Automation

**Purpose**: This file is automatically read by Claude Code at the start of EVERY session.

**Effect**: Enforces critical checks without user having to remember.

---

## 🚨 AUTOMATIC SESSION STARTUP SEQUENCE

### Step 1: Token Budget Check (MANDATORY)

**Current token usage**: [Claude will report this]

**Health Assessment**:
- ✅ **< 50K tokens**: Healthy - proceed normally
- ⚠️ **50-100K tokens**: Warning - can you finish current task in < 50K more?
  - If NO → Update NEXT_SESSION.md and start fresh session
- 🛑 **> 100K tokens**: CRITICAL - STOP
  - DO NOT start new work
  - Update NEXT_SESSION.md
  - Close session and start fresh

**Action Required**: Acknowledge token health status before proceeding.

---

### Step 2: Project Detection (AUTOMATIC)

**Checking git remote and directory structure...**

**Detection logic**:
```bash
# Git remote check
git remote -v
# If contains "nudj-digital" → NUDJ (work)
# If contains "aperture" → APERTURE (personal)

# Directory structure check
# NUDJ: apps/api, apps/admin, pnpm-workspace.yaml
# APERTURE: projects/wizard-of-oz, .process/
```

**Action Required**: Confirm project type and state which CLAUDE.md to follow.

---

### Step 3: Read Current Status (MANDATORY)

**YOU MUST READ**:
1. `CLAUDE-APERTURE.md` or `CLAUDE-NUDJ.md` - Check "Current Tasks & Status" section
2. `NEXT_SESSION.md` - Detailed implementation context

**CLAUDE-APERTURE.md contains**:
- High-level current sprint tasks (single source of truth)
- Recent completions with verification status
- Active work with verification commands
- Blockers

**NEXT_SESSION.md contains**:
- Detailed implementation notes
- Technical context and decisions
- Infrastructure status
- Key resources and commands

**Action Required**: After reading BOTH files, state:
```
Current sprint (from CLAUDE-APERTURE.md): [high-level tasks]
Today's focus (from NEXT_SESSION.md): [specific implementation]
Verification ready: [can I verify my work?]
Any blockers: [yes/no]
```

---

### Step 4: Debugging Protocol (IF DEBUGGING)

**If user mentions**: "doesn't work", "broken", "failing", "error", "bug"

**🚨 MANDATORY - Follow this exact sequence**:

1. **FIRST**: Read `META_DEBUGGING_PROTOCOL.md` (5 min)
   - Universal debugging principles
   - Input verification checklist
   - 80% of bugs are input issues

2. **SECOND**: Check infrastructure
   ```
   /verify-infra [project-name]
   ```
   - Catches environment/setup issues
   - Database, storage, env vars

3. **THIRD**: Verify inputs before debugging algorithm
   - See META_DEBUGGING_PROTOCOL.md for checklist
   - Log what you RECEIVE vs what you EXPECT
   - If mismatch → fix input, not algorithm

4. **ONLY THEN**: Debug the algorithm/logic

**Why this order?**
- Meta protocol: Prevents wasting 90+ minutes debugging wrong thing
- Infrastructure check: Catches 80% of deployment issues
- Input verification: Catches 80% of logic issues
- **Together: Saves hours of debugging time**

**Common issues caught by protocol**:
- Input format mismatches (dimensions, units, scaling)
- Database tables don't exist
- Storage buckets missing
- Environment variables not set
- Vercel Deployment Protection enabled (blocks server-to-server calls)

---

### Step 4.5: Production Health Check (AUTOMATIC for Aperture)

> **📍 Full guide → `.process/PROACTIVE_LOG_MONITORING.md`**

**For Aperture projects only** - Proactively check production logs for errors.

**Quick check** (60 seconds):

```bash
# 1. Check last deployment status
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer FWsU3v4DJU8HKGZYb63exOIf" \
  "https://api.vercel.com/v6/deployments?projectId=prj_rkI3NQOI5SfBle7lflFkwFkj0eYd&limit=1" \
  | python3 -c "import sys, json; d = json.load(sys.stdin)['deployments'][0]; print(f\"State: {d['state']}\nError: {d.get('errorMessage', 'None')}\")"

# 2. Check alignment pipeline (critical)
/vercel-logs align-photo-v4 10

# 3. Check eye detection (critical)
/vercel-logs detect-eyes 10
```

**Report format**:
```
Production Health: 🟢 Healthy / 🟡 Warning / 🔴 Critical

Last deployment: [state]
Alignment logs: [X successes, Y failures]
Eye detection: [X successes, Y failures]

Issues: [if any]
Action needed: [yes/no]
```

**If 🔴 Critical issues found**:
1. Stop new work
2. Document in session notes
3. Fix production issue first
4. Update NEXT_SESSION.md

**Why this matters**:
- Catch issues before user reports them
- Fix production bugs within 5 minutes of occurrence
- Build trust through proactive monitoring
- Learn from error patterns

---

### Step 5: Validation Before Starting Work

**Confirm you have**:
- ✅ Token budget status (and it's acceptable to continue)
- ✅ Project type identified (NUDJ or Aperture)
- ✅ Current sprint tasks from CLAUDE-[PROJECT].md
- ✅ Detailed context from NEXT_SESSION.md
- ✅ Verification commands available for tasks
- ✅ Today's focus is clear

**If ANY is unclear**: Ask user before proceeding.

**Before executing any task**: Confirm verification method is documented.

---

### Step 5.5: Parallel Execution Policy

**When working on tasks, maximize efficiency by running independent operations in parallel.**

**Parallel execution checklist**:
- ✅ File reads that aren't dependent on each other
- ✅ Multiple grep/glob searches
- ✅ Git status + git diff + git log
- ✅ Multiple bash commands that don't depend on each other
- ✅ Infrastructure checks across different services

**Communication pattern**:
```
I'm going to run these operations in parallel:
1. [Operation 1]
2. [Operation 2]
3. [Operation 3]

[Execute all in single message with multiple tool calls]
```

**Examples**:

**GOOD - Parallel file reads**:
```
Single message with 3 Read tool calls:
- Read: src/components/Upload.tsx
- Read: src/components/Gallery.tsx
- Read: src/lib/imageUtils.ts
```

**BAD - Sequential when could be parallel**:
```
Message 1: Read src/components/Upload.tsx
[wait]
Message 2: Read src/components/Gallery.tsx
[wait]
Message 3: Read src/lib/imageUtils.ts
```

**GOOD - Parallel git inspection**:
```
Single message with 3 Bash tool calls:
- git status
- git diff
- git log --oneline -10
```

**Why this matters**:
- ⚡ 3x faster execution
- 🎯 Better token efficiency
- 🔄 More work per session

---

### Step 5.6: Subagent Task Delegation

**Use Task tool proactively for specialized work that can run in parallel.**

**When to delegate to subagents**:
- 🔍 **deep-research** - Understanding APIs, best practices, documentation
- 🔎 **codebase-pattern-analyzer** - Tracing features, understanding architecture
- ✅ **check-and-challenge** - After implementing significant features
- 📝 **docs-writer/docs-reviewer** - Creating/updating user guides

**Parallel subagent pattern**:
```
I'm going to launch 2 agents in parallel:
1. deep-research: Investigate best practices for X
2. codebase-pattern-analyzer: Find all files related to Y

[Single message with 2 Task tool calls]
```

**Benefits**:
- ⚡ Work continues while agents gather information
- 🎯 Specialized expertise for specific tasks
- 🔀 True parallel development (research + implementation simultaneously)

**Example use cases**:
- Launch research agent to find best practices while implementing feature
- Start code review agent on completed feature while working on next feature
- Run pattern analyzer to understand architecture while planning changes

---

### Step 5.7: Checkpoint Before Major Changes

**Create checkpoints before risky or significant changes.**

**When to checkpoint**:
- 🔧 Major refactoring (changing architecture, moving files)
- ✨ New feature implementation (significant additions)
- 🔄 Database migrations or schema changes
- 🚨 High-risk fixes (touching critical code paths)
- 🎯 Any change where you think "I hope this works"

**How to checkpoint**:
1. Ensure current state is stable
2. Add entry to NEXT_SESSION.md under "Session Checkpoints"
3. Document what's working, what you'll change, risk level
4. Note current git commit for potential rollback
5. Proceed with changes

**Format**:
```markdown
### Checkpoint 1 - 2025-10-13 14:30 - Refactor alignment algorithm

**What's working**:
- Upload system functional
- Eye detection working
- Basic alignment operational

**About to change**:
- Refactor alignPhoto() to use matrix transformations
- May affect existing alignment logic

**Risk level**: Medium

**Rollback**: git checkout ba2603e -- src/lib/imageUtils.ts
```

**After change**:
- ✅ Success: Mark checkpoint as complete
- ❌ Failed: Use rollback command, document what went wrong

**Why this matters**:
- 🔒 Safe experimentation without fear
- ⏮️ Quick recovery if things break
- 📊 Learning from what went wrong
- 🎯 Confidence to try bold improvements

---

### Step 6: MANDATORY - Update Documentation During Work

**🚨 CRITICAL**: NEXT_SESSION.md must be updated DURING the session, NOT just at the end.

**Update frequency**:
- ✅ After completing ANY task
- ✅ After discovering important information
- ✅ After fixing a bug
- ✅ After changing direction
- ✅ Every 30 minutes of active work

**What to update**:
```markdown
**Last Updated**: [timestamp] (Session [N] - [brief context])

**Current Work**: [one sentence what you're doing right now]

[In Priority sections]:
- Status changed from X to Y
- Added new findings
- Updated what's deployed
- Changed next action required
```

**Why this matters**:
- Next Claude session reads NEXT_SESSION.md first
- If it's out of date, they waste time on wrong context
- Documentation debt compounds quickly
- User frustration when docs don't match reality

**Enforcement**:
- System will remind you if 30+ minutes pass without update
- If you close session without updating → you failed the session
- This is NOT optional

---

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement Enforcement

### When You Make a Mistake

**STOP - Before continuing**:

1. **Identify root cause** (not symptom):
   ```
   Symptom: "Code didn't work"
   Root cause: "Infrastructure check wasn't run before debugging"

   Fix: Add infrastructure check to automatic startup sequence
   ```

2. **Fix process, not just code**:
   - If you forgot to check something → Add to this file
   - If documentation was unclear → Update the doc
   - If you repeated a mistake → Create automation

3. **Update COMMON_MISTAKES.md immediately**:
   ```markdown
   ## [Date] | [Category] | [Title]
   **What Happened**: [One sentence]
   **Root Cause**: [The actual reason, not symptom]
   **Process Fix**: [How we prevent this permanently]
   ```

4. **Update task status**:
   - If task failed verification → Update CLAUDE-[PROJECT].md with blocker
   - If task completed → Mark [x] in CLAUDE-[PROJECT].md AND NEXT_SESSION.md
   - If discovered subtasks → Add to both files

5. **Propose automation**:
   ```
   "This mistake happened because [manual step].
   We should automate this by [specific solution].
   Shall I implement that now?"
   ```

### Red Flags That Need Process Fixes

**If you hear yourself saying**:
- "Remember to..." → Should be automated
- "Don't forget to..." → Should be enforced
- "Make sure you..." → Should be checked automatically
- "We did this before..." → Should be documented/automated

**Action**: Stop and propose process improvement before continuing.

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Catch

### Symptom Fixing (BAD)
```
User: "Upload doesn't work"
You: [Debug code for 2 hours]
Result: Bucket didn't exist
```

### Root Cause Fixing (GOOD)
```
User: "Upload doesn't work"
You: "Let's run /verify-infra first - checks if buckets exist"
Result: Bucket missing, created in 2 minutes
```

### Repeating Mistakes (BAD)
```
Session 1: Forgot to check token budget → hit 120K
Session 2: Forgot to check token budget → hit 120K
Session 3: Forgot to check token budget → hit 120K
```

### Learning from Mistakes (GOOD)
```
Session 1: Forgot to check token budget → hit 120K
Fix: Added token check to automatic startup (this file)
Session 2+: Token check happens automatically
```

---

## 📋 Enforcement Checklist

**At start of EVERY session**, you must:

- [ ] Report token budget status (< 50K / 50-100K / > 100K)
- [ ] Identify project (NUDJ or Aperture) and state which CLAUDE.md to follow
- [ ] Read NEXT_SESSION.md and confirm current status
- [ ] If user reports "doesn't work" → suggest /verify-infra BEFORE debugging

**If you skip any step**: User should remind you to read this file.

---

## 🔧 How to Update This File

**When you discover a repeated mistake**:

1. Add to this file (automated enforcement)
2. Update relevant process docs (documentation)
3. Create automation if possible (tools/commands)
4. Update COMMON_MISTAKES.md (learning)

**Example**:
```
Mistake: Forgot to check if tests pass before committing
Fix: Add to this file → "Before committing, YOU MUST: npm run test"
Better: Add git pre-commit hook that runs tests automatically
```

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**This file is working when**:
- ✅ Token budget never exceeds 100K (caught automatically)
- ✅ Infrastructure issues caught in < 5 min (suggested automatically)
- ✅ Same mistake never happens 3+ times (process fixed after 2nd occurrence)
- ✅ New automations added when patterns emerge

**This file is failing when**:
- ❌ Token budget regularly exceeds 100K
- ❌ Debugging code for > 30 min before checking infrastructure
- ❌ Same mistake happens repeatedly
- ❌ Manual steps that should be automated
