# Aperture Skills

A collection of specialized skills for Claude Code to improve development workflows on Aperture projects.

## What are Skills?

Skills are self-contained folders with instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude automatically loads when relevant to your task. They enable:

- **Composable**: Multiple skills work together automatically
- **Portable**: Same format across Claude apps, Claude Code, and API
- **Efficient**: Only relevant information loads when needed
- **Powerful**: Include executable scripts for reliable automation

## How Claude Uses Skills

### Automatic Activation

Claude automatically identifies which skills are relevant based on:
- User's question or request
- Current working directory
- Files being edited
- Project context

### Progressive Loading

Claude loads only what's needed:
1. **SKILL.md** loads when skill triggers
2. **Additional files** load on-demand
3. **Scripts** execute when needed

### Composability

Multiple skills can activate together:
- `aperture-router` + `wizard-of-oz` when working on photo app
- `session-management` + `development-workflow` when starting work
- `wizard-of-oz` + `vercel-deployment` when deploying

## Using Skills Manually

### View Available Skills

```bash
ls -la .claude/skills/
```

### Run Helper Scripts

```bash
# Project detection
./.claude/skills/aperture-router/detect-project.sh

# Wizard of Oz tasks
./.claude/skills/wizard-of-oz/common-tasks.sh [command]

# Development workflow
./.claude/skills/development-workflow/dev-commands.sh [command]

# Deploy to Vercel
./.claude/skills/vercel-deployment/deploy.sh
```

### Read Skill Documentation

Each skill's `SKILL.md` contains:
- Trigger conditions
- Instructions
- Examples
- Guidelines

## Skill Structure

Standard format for each skill:

```
skill-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md              # Required: Main instructions with YAML frontmatter
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ additional-docs.md    # Optional: Supplementary documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helper.sh         # Optional: Executable scripts
```

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# Skill Name

## Purpose
[What this skill provides]

## When to Activate
[Trigger conditions]

## Instructions
[Detailed guidance]

## Examples
[Usage examples]

## Guidelines

```

## Creating New Skills

### 1. Create Skill Directory

```bash
mkdir .claude/skills/new-skill
```

### 2. Create SKILL.md

```markdown
---
name: new-skill
description: What it does and when to use it (max 1024 chars)
---

# New Skill

[Instructions for Claude]
```

### 3. Add Resources (Optional)

```bash
# Additional documentation
touch .claude/skills/new-skill/reference.md

# Helper scripts
touch .claude/skills/new-skill/helper.sh
chmod +x .claude/skills/new-skill/helper.sh
```

### 4. Update This README

Add your skill to the "Available Skills" section.

## Best Practices

### Skill Design

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Clear, specific trigger conditions
- ‚úÖ Concise SKILL.md (focus on essentials)
- ‚úÖ Additional files for deep dives
- ‚úÖ Executable scripts for repetitive tasks
- ‚úÖ Examples and guidelines

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Duplicate content across skills
- ‚ùå Make SKILL.md too long (use additional files)
- ‚ùå Overlap skill purposes
- ‚ùå Include secrets or credentials

### Documentation

- Keep SKILL.md focused and scannable
- Use additional .md files for detailed info
- Include practical examples
- Reference related skills

### Scripts

- Make scripts executable (`chmod +x`)
- Include error handling
- Use clear output messages
- Test before committing

## Integration with Existing Docs

Skills complement existing documentation:

**Skills (`.claude/skills/`):**
- Auto-loaded when relevant
- Focused, specific workflows
- Executable helpers
- Context-aware

**CLAUDE.md files:**
- Always-available reference
- Comprehensive patterns
- Architecture details
- Project overview

**Use both together** for optimal Claude Code experience.

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activating

1. Check trigger conditions in SKILL.md
2. Verify file structure is correct
3. Ensure SKILL.md has valid YAML frontmatter
4. Check description is clear and specific

### Script Not Working

1. Verify script is executable (`chmod +x`)
2. Check file paths are correct
3. Review error messages
4. Test script manually

### Need More Help

- Review [Anthropic Skills documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview)
- Check existing skills for examples
- Ask Claude to help debug
