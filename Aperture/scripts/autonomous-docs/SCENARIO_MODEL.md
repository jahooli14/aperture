# Autonomous Documentation System - Scenario Model

## Test Scenario: Claude Skills Announcement

### Input Data
- **Source**: Anthropic News (web-scrape)
- **URL**: https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills
- **Title**: "Claude Skills: Customize AI for your workflows"
- **Keywords**: claude, skills, api, anthropic

---

## Flow Walkthrough

### Phase 1: Fetch Articles ✅

**File**: `src/fetch-sources.ts:131-227` (WebScrapeFetcher)

1. Fetch HTML from https://www.anthropic.com/news
2. Extract links matching `/news/` pattern
3. For each link:
   - Check if link text contains keywords: ["claude", "skills", "api", "anthropic"]
   - Build full URL: https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills
   - **Fetch article content** (lines 208, 231-290):
     - GET https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills
     - Extract `<meta property="og:description">` → summary
     - Extract `<article>` content → full content (~3000 chars)
     - Extract `<time datetime>` → publish date
4. Create Article object:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: "2025-10-16-skills",
     title: "Claude Skills: Customize AI for your workflows",
     url: "https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills",
     content: "Skills are folders that include instructions...", // ~3000 chars
     summary: "Build custom Skills to teach Claude...",
     publishDate: new Date("2025-10-16"),
     source: "anthropic-news",
     sourceAuthority: 1.0
   }
   ```

**Expected Output**: Array with 1+ articles containing Claude Skills

**Potential Issues**:
- ❌ Empty content: FIXED - now fetches article content
- ❌ No keyword match: FIXED - "claude" and "skills" are in keywords
- ✅ Rate limiting: Handled with try-catch

---

### Phase 2: Analyze Relevance ✅

**File**: `src/filter-relevance.ts:13-162`

1. Send article to Gemini AI with prompt:
   - Article title: "Claude Skills: Customize AI for your workflows"
   - Article content: 2000 chars of actual content
   - Categories: anthropic | gemini | patterns | tools | other
   - Scoring: 0.0-1.0

2. AI Response (expected):
   ```json
   [
     {
       "articleIndex": 1,
       "relevanceScore": 0.95,
       "category": "anthropic",
       "reasoning": [
         "Official Anthropic announcement of new Claude feature",
         "Directly applicable to Claude API and agent development",
         "Contains specific implementation details for Skills"
       ],
       "isRelevant": true
     }
   ]
   ```

3. Parse JSON (lines 114-159):
   - Try pattern 1: ````json\n...\n```
   - Try pattern 2: ````json\n...` (truncated)
   - Try pattern 3: `[...]` (bare array)
   - **NEW**: Auto-set `isRelevant=true` if `relevanceScore >= 0.7` (line 135-137)

4. Filter relevant (line 158-162):
   - Check: `isRelevant === true` AND `relevanceScore >= 0.7`
   - Result: PASS (0.95 >= 0.7)

**Expected Output**: 1 relevant article

**Potential Issues**:
- ❌ "No JSON found": FIXED - added 3 fallback patterns
- ❌ Missing `isRelevant` field: FIXED - auto-set based on score
- ❌ Truncated response: FIXED - pattern 2 handles unclosed fences
- ✅ API errors: Handled with try-catch fallback to mark as relevant

---

### Phase 3: Compare Quality ✅

**File**: `src/compare-quality.ts:71-122, 301-416`

1. Find relevant documentation section (lines 75, 124-140):
   - Search keywords: ["claude", "skills", "api"]
   - Check files: CLAUDE-APERTURE.md, .claude/startup.md, .process/COMMON_MISTAKES.md
   - Result: **No existing "Claude Skills" section found**

2. **NEW**: Evaluate as new content (lines 78-80, 301-416):
   - Call `evaluateNewContent(article)`
   - Score on 4 dimensions:
     - Specificity: 0.9 (concrete examples, exact APIs)
     - Implementability: 0.8 (clear integration steps)
     - Evidence: 1.0 (official Anthropic source)
     - Relevance: 0.95 (directly applicable to our stack)
   - Overall score: 0.9
   - Suggested file: "CLAUDE-APERTURE.md"
   - Suggested section: "Claude Skills"

3. Check merge criteria (lines 88-91):
   - Overall score >= 0.75: ✅ (0.9)
   - Relevance >= 0.6: ✅ (0.95)
   - At least 2 dimensions >= 0.7: ✅ (all 4)

**Expected Output**: QualityComparison with `shouldMerge: true`

**Potential Issues**:
- ❌ Method not found: FIXED - `evaluateNewContent` now inside class (line 301)
- ❌ Rejected for no section: FIXED - now evaluates as NEW content
- ✅ Quality threshold: Will pass (0.9 >= 0.75)

---

### Phase 4: Generate Integration ✅

**File**: `src/generate-integration.ts`

1. Take QualityComparison from Phase 3
2. Generate markdown section:
   ```markdown
   ## Claude Skills

   Skills are customizable folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources
   that enhance Claude's task-specific capabilities.

   ### Key Features
   - Composable: Skills can stack together
   - Portable: Same format across platforms
   - Efficient: Loads only necessary resources

   Source: [Claude Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills)
   ```

3. Create MergeResult:
   - targetFile: "CLAUDE-APERTURE.md"
   - targetSection: "Claude Skills"
   - beforeContent: "" (new section)
   - afterContent: (generated markdown)

**Expected Output**: MergeResult ready to apply

---

### Phase 5: Validate and Apply Changes ✅

**File**: `src/apply-changes.ts`

1. Validate merge result:
   - Check file exists: ✅ CLAUDE-APERTURE.md exists
   - Check section growth: ✅ New section
   - Check daily limit: ✅ Under maxDailyChanges (5)

2. Apply changes:
   - Read CLAUDE-APERTURE.md
   - Find insertion point (end of file or before a delimiter)
   - Insert new section
   - Write file

**Expected Output**: File updated successfully

---

### Phase 6-7: Audit Trail & Changelog ✅

**Files**: `src/audit-changelog.ts`

1. Log merge to audit trail:
   ```json
   {
     "timestamp": "2025-10-17T...",
     "type": "merged",
     "sourceArticle": {
       "title": "Claude Skills: Customize AI for your workflows",
       "url": "https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills",
       "publishDate": "2025-10-16"
     },
     "targetFile": "CLAUDE-APERTURE.md",
     "targetSection": "Claude Skills",
     "qualityScores": {
       "specificity": 0.9,
       "implementability": 0.8,
       "evidence": 1.0,
       "overall": 0.9
     }
   }
   ```

2. Generate changelog:
   ```markdown
   # Documentation Updates - 2025-10-17

   ## Summary
   - Articles analyzed: 9
   - Relevant: 1
   - Merged: 1

   ## Merged Improvements

   ### Claude Skills
   **Source**: [Anthropic News](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills)
   **File**: CLAUDE-APERTURE.md
   **Quality**: 0.9/1.0

   Added new section documenting Claude Skills feature...
   ```

---

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Fixes Made ✅
1. **Empty article content**: Now fetches full content from article pages
2. **Missing isRelevant field**: Auto-set based on relevance score
3. **JSON parsing failures**: 3 fallback patterns for extraction
4. **Rejected new topics**: Now evaluates NEW content instead of rejecting
5. **Method not found**: `evaluateNewContent` properly scoped in class

### Remaining Risks ⚠️

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - **Risk**: Fetching 10+ article pages sequentially could be slow
   - **Mitigation**: Articles processed in batches of 20 (filter-relevance.ts:19)
   - **Impact**: LOW - workflow runs once daily

2. **HTML Parsing Fragility**
   - **Risk**: Anthropic changes their HTML structure
   - **Mitigation**: Multiple fallbacks (og:description, meta, article tag)
   - **Impact**: MEDIUM - would silently skip articles

3. **AI Response Format**
   - **Risk**: Gemini returns unexpected JSON structure
   - **Mitigation**: Try-catch with fallback to mark as relevant
   - **Impact**: LOW - fallback handles gracefully

4. **Merge Conflicts**
   - **Risk**: Multiple sections with same name
   - **Mitigation**: Section names from AI are specific
   - **Impact**: LOW - unlikely with descriptive names
