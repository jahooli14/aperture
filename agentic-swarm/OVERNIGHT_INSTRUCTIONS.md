# Overnight Mega Research Instructions

## 🚀 What's Running

**Task:** Complete Production-Ready AI Agent Platform Guide
**Workers:** 10-15 agents researching in parallel
**Duration:** 1-3 hours
**Cost:** $0 (FREE with GLM)

The swarm will research and create a comprehensive 100+ page guide covering:
- Technical architecture
- Security & compliance
- Cost modeling
- Technology stack evaluation
- Deployment strategies
- API design
- Business model
- Go-to-market strategy
- Operations playbook
- ...and 6 more sections

## 📺 Watch It Live

### Option 1: Watch Progress Log (Recommended)
```bash
# In a new terminal
cd /Users/danielcroome-horgan/aperture/agentic-swarm
tail -f overnight-progress.log
```

This shows:
- Workers being spawned
- Tasks being delegated
- Progress updates in real-time
- Final completion message

### Option 2: Check Progress Periodically
```bash
# Check how far along it is
cat overnight-progress.log | grep "Delegating task"
cat overnight-progress.log | grep "completed"

# See worker count
cat overnight-progress.log | grep "Workers spawned"
```

### Option 3: Watch Output File Size Grow
```bash
# Watch the file being written
watch -n 5 'ls -lh overnight-research-output.md 2>/dev/null || echo "Not created yet"'
```

## 📍 Where to Find Results

**When you wake up, check these files:**

1. **Main Output** (100+ pages):
   ```bash
   cat overnight-research-output.md
   # or open in your editor
   open overnight-research-output.md
   ```

2. **Execution Log** (what happened):
   ```bash
   cat overnight-progress.log
   ```

3. **Quick Summary** (at end of progress log):
   ```bash
   tail -20 overnight-progress.log
   ```

## 📊 What You'll Get

The final `overnight-research-output.md` will include:

- **Executive Summary** - TL;DR of entire guide
- **15 Deep-Dive Sections** - Each researched by dedicated workers
- **Architecture Diagrams** - ASCII art visual representations
- **Cost Tables** - Provider comparisons at different scales
- **Technology Matrices** - Decision frameworks
- **Code Examples** - Practical implementations
- **Real-World Examples** - Case studies from production systems
- **Timeline & Milestones** - Implementation roadmap
- **Risk Analysis** - What could go wrong and how to prevent it

## 🔍 Monitoring While Running

### Check if still running:
```bash
ps aux | grep "overnight-mega-research"
```

### Check how many workers spawned:
```bash
grep -c "Delegating task" overnight-progress.log
```

### See token usage so far:
```bash
grep "tokens" overnight-progress.log | tail -1
```

## 🛑 Stop Early (if needed)

If you need to stop it:
```bash
# Find the process
ps aux | grep "overnight-mega-research"

# Kill it (replace PID with actual process ID)
kill <PID>
```

Don't worry - it's FREE so you're not wasting money!

## ⏰ Expected Timeline

- **0-10 min**: Orchestrator analyzes task, spawns first workers
- **10-30 min**: Workers research their topics in parallel
- **30-60 min**: More workers spawned, deep research continues
- **60-120 min**: Workers complete, orchestrator synthesizes
- **120-180 min**: Final comprehensive report written

## 💡 Tips

1. **Don't interrupt it** - Let it run to completion for best results
2. **`tail -f` is your friend** - Watch progress in real-time
3. **Check in the morning** - Will be complete with full report
4. **It's FREE** - Using GLM Flash, so no cost even if it runs for hours

## 🎉 What Makes This Special

Unlike asking me (Claude Code) for this report:
- ✅ **10-15 workers** researching simultaneously
- ✅ **Autonomous** - runs while you sleep
- ✅ **Deep research** - each worker focuses on one aspect
- ✅ **FREE** - $0 cost with GLM
- ✅ **100+ pages** - comprehensive, actionable guide
- ✅ **Real-time progress** - watch it work live

VS. asking me:
- ❌ Single perspective
- ❌ Limited by context window
- ❌ You must be present
- ❌ Can't run overnight
- ❌ Sequential, not parallel

## 📞 In the Morning

When you check back:
```bash
cd /Users/danielcroome-horgan/aperture/agentic-swarm

# See the magic
cat overnight-research-output.md | wc -l  # How many lines?
cat overnight-research-output.md | head -50  # First 50 lines

# Full metrics
tail -30 overnight-progress.log
```

**Enjoy your comprehensive AI platform guide in the morning!** ☕️
