22. "monitoring_observability" - Metrics, logging, tracing at scale
23. "disaster_recovery" - Backup strategies, failover, data replication
24. "energy_efficiency" - Green AI, carbon tracking, sustainable computing

For EACH delegation:
- task_id: descriptive name
- objective: "Research [topic] comprehensively including: current state-of-art, vendors/tools, benchmarks, best practices, common pitfalls, future trends, cost analysis, implementation examples"
- output_format: "Detailed markdown section (5,000+ tokens) with: overview, technical details, vendor comparison table, cost analysis, code examples, architecture diagrams (ASCII), case studies, recommendations"
- tool_guidance: "Use all available tools extensively. Search for latest information, calculate costs, analyze data."

AFTER ALL DELEGATIONS: Synthesize into structured markdown with clear sections.

YOUR TASK:
For EACH topic covered in Stage 1, spawn 2-3 workers to:
1. Research implementation details
2. Build proof-of-concept examples
3. Compare 5+ vendor solutions
4. Calculate ROI and TCO
5. Identify integration challenges
6. Document edge cases

DELEGATION STRATEGY:
- 30+ workers minimum
- Each worker: 10,000+ token output
- Request code examples, architecture diagrams, cost models
- Cross-reference findings between workers

EXAMPLE DELEGATIONS:

For "Edge Computing":
- "edge_compute_terraform" - IaC examples for edge deployment
- "edge_compute_cost_model" - Detailed cost analysis across providers
- "edge_compute_case_studies" - Real implementations from Netflix, Cloudflare, etc.

For "Foundation Models":
- "llm_serving_vllm_triton" - vLLM vs Triton benchmarks
- "llm_cost_optimization" - Spot instances, batching, caching strategies
- "llm_multi_model_serving" - Serving 10+ models efficiently

SPAWN 30+ WORKERS. For each Stage 1 topic, create 2-3 deep-dive workers.
